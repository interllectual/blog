I have changed the typography on this site about 50 times now. I keep going back and forth between [Petrona](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Petrona) and [Gentium Basic](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Gentium+Basic) for the body text. This is becoming an unhealthy obsession, and it is just a way of procrastinating from writing anything.
