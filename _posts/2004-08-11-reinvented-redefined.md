<p>&#8230; rearranged but not refined</p><p>(to paraphrase Phish)</p><p>The design is coming soon.</p><p>Some features to look forward to:</p><ul><li><strong>The Interllectual Gallery</strong>,  wherein you will find a tribute to the very American notion that spelling the name wrong will somehow inspire confidence in your product</li><li><strong>The &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Have Time&#8221; Meter</strong>, wherein I track how many times I&#8217;ve heard someone at work tell me they &#8220;don&#8217;t have time&#8221; to do something, balanced by how many times I&#8217;ve said it myself.  It is some kind of academic pissing contest to inflate your busy-ness factor.  If you&#8217;re too busy to perform basic bodily functions you win.</li><li><strong>The <span class="caps">ASAP</span> Meter</strong>, wherein I track how often I get requests with unrealistic deadlines.</li></ul><p>This site is being built with <a href="http://textpattern.com/">Textpattern</a>, which is now running the <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~humboldt/index.php">monstrosity at work</a>.  I love it.</p>
