Woke up this morning to more Boston marathon insanity. One of the suspects is dead, and the entire city is on lockdown while they search door to door for the other. I am torn between wanting to go on with my life as usual, and feeling like that is a callus thing to do in a time like this. Torn between wanting to be on social media talking to my friends, and wanting to be as far away from it as possible to not fall into the trap of rumors and fear and lies. Not sure if it is better for my psyche to tune in or tune out.
