<p>This title was supplied by Brian, who very patiently listened to me go on about how my feeds were broken and I had no idea why.  When I told him I finally figured out that it was because of some extra whitespace in my comments.php file, he said &#8220;That sounds like the punchline to a really geeky joke.&#8221;  And it pretty much is. Anyway, my feeds are fixed.</p>

<p>I leave tomorrow to go to the <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery/default.asp">E-recruitment conference</a>, where I will be speaking.  The preparation has been pretty torturous, and I&#8217;m dreading the punchline to come.</p>

<p>The plane ride may be a good time to ponder <a href="http://blog.webx.com.au/archives/2005/10/front_end_is_technology">what Chris just wrote</a>, as I delve more and more into marketing and try to figure out how to balance all the separate and conflicting pulls at my expertise.  I&#8217;m looking forward to meeting folks in the same boat, so say Hi if you&#8217;re there, and maybe we can have a margarita or some coffee.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll put my slides up here this weekend when I get back from sunny San Diego.  Til then, you&#8217;ll have a (much needed?) break from my really geeky jokes.</p>
