<p>As you can see, I scrapped the old design.  I just wasn&#8217;t feeling it.  I kept trying to improve it, and it kept getting muddier and muddier.</p><p>So I spent this afternoon stripping all the styles and working on the structure.  I wasn&#8217;t going to even deal with design until I gave it a rest for a while.</p><p>Then, when I was about to stop, I had a burst of inspiration and had to get it down before I lost it.</p><p>So there you go. I ended up spending 3 times as long as I intended, and I haven&#8217;t eaten for hours.  I love this feeling.</p>
