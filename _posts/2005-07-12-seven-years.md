<p>This being 7/11, Brian and I have officially been married 7 years.  Traditional gifts for year 7 are copper and wool.  The modern alternative is desk sets.</p>

<p>Desk sets?!?  What I love about Brian is that he knows I will kick his ass if he ever gives me a desk set as an anniversary gift.</p>

<p>Usually, for our anniversary we choose one gift that we both give to each other&#8212; something we both want and will use together.  We&#8217;re trying to decide if year 7 is going be the year of <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~carts/">Center Arts</a> season tickets (<em>got</em> to see <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~carts/season.php?id=16">John Cleese!</a>), or home entertainment systems.  I kind of wanted it to be the year of puppies, but Brian nixed that one.  I think his actual words were &#8220;Hell No&#8221;.  </p>

<p>It has already been the year of new closet doors which is <em>much</em> more exciting than it sounds.  Now I can see all my shoes!</p>

<p>One thing we&#8217;re sure of though&#8212; this year is going to be a helluva lot less about desk sets than the last.</p>
