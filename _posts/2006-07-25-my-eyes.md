<p>Ok, I&#8217;m going to show my uncoolness here by admitting that I never really saw the point of <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">Technorati</a> in the first place. But really, was <a href="http://www.technorati.com/">this redesign</a> necessary? And could it be fuglier?  I&#8217;m <a href="http://janglyganglia.com">not afraid of bright colors</a>, but that design just seared a hole in my brain. And, there are <em>drop shadows on the icons</em>.  Just when I thought I couldn&#8217;t hate stupid little icons any more&#8230;  Just another reason for me not to go to Technorati, just like I didn&#8217;t before.</p>
