<p>doingfine is now interllectual.</p>
<p>I decided that the reason I haven&#8217;t been writing was twofold:</p>
<ol><li>movabletype was too clunky and frustrating, and</li><li>I needed a site name I could really get behind.</li></ol><p>doingfine always seemed like a cheesy name to me, and the <a href="http://interllectual.com/article/2/here-we-go">original premise</a>, although important, just wasn&#8217;t inspiring.</p><p>Interllectual is a much better name for these reasons:</p><ol><li>it exemplifies my cutting wit</li><li>it gives a nod to my job, which is managing the internet (OK really the web, but webllectual wasn&#8217;t as funny) for an <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~humboldt/index.php">intellectual institution</a></li><li>it makes fun of all the academic wonks and self-proclaimed intellectuals I work with everyday (I include myself in this group, but I&#8217;m smarter that all them other guys&#8230;)</li><li>it embraces my biggest pet-peeve, which is spelling things wrong on purpose, especially for marketing (qwick, lite, nite, etc&#8230;)</li><li>it has many other meanings if you really think about it</li></ol><p>Hopefully it will spark me on toward posting more often.</p><p>If nothing else, I get to redesign again.  Expect this bare-bones install to start looking groovy in the next couple of weeks.</p>
