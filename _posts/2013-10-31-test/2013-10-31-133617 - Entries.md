Fooling around with the new work computer, which will also be doubling as my personal computer since I spilled coffee into my laptop. 

Trying to get a workflow for writing going again. Still trying to figure out the right balance between public and private. Not sure where a personal web site fits in to this picture. I never seem to have anything to write when I think about publishing there. Would like to collect my links and quotes there, but still missing an intuitive workflow there.
