<p>I have been saddened beyond words by the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina.  </p>

<p>New Orleans, besides being one of my favorite places in the US and one of the few places in this country where the culture truly shines through, is home to several institutions of higer ed, including <a href="http://www2.tulane.edu/">Tulane University</a>, <a href="http://www.xulaemergency.com/">Xavier University</a>, <a href="http://www.loyno.edu/">Loyola University</a>, <a href="http://www.suno.edu/">Southern Univesity at New Orleans</a>, <a href="http://www.uno.edu/">University of New Orleans</a>, and <a href="http://www.dillard.edu/">Dillard University</a>.  (Note that not all of these sites are online, due to hurricane damage.)  The result is thousands of students that have been displaced from their schools.</p>

<p>Many colleges and universities around the country are offering help to students and their families who have been affected by the hurricane.  Here is a list of what I have seen so far, and I will be updating it as I learn more.</p>

</ul></h2>

<p>This list is (thankfully) getting too long for me to accurately miantain. You can find additional lists on the Web site of the <a href="http://www.scup.org/knowledge/katrina/offers.html">Society for College and University Planning</a> and the Web site of the <a href="http://www.naicu.edu/HEA/KatrinaEfforts.shtml">National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities</a>.</p>

<h2>Another 9/6/05 Update</h2>

<p>A list-serv has been established to allow Katrina affected students to communicate with each other.  <a href="https://listserver.itd.umich.edu/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?enter=katrina-students">Sign up here</a></p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://www.scup.org/knowledge/katrina/">The Society of College and University Plannning</a> has set up a mailing list to facilitate communications among university stakeholders, and <a href="http://www.educause.edu/content.asp?PAGE_ID=8584&#38;bhcp=1">Educause</a> has set up a Hurricane Relief Community Exchange &#8220;which allows (A) institutions needing assistance to describe their needs and (B) institutions interested in helping to see those needs and, if possible, to follow up&#8221;.</p>

<p>The easiest way to donate or volunteer to help victims is through the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">Red Cross</a>.</p>

<p>My heart goes out to everyone affected by this tragedy. If your school has a program set up that I have missed, please let me know and I will add it to the list.</p>
