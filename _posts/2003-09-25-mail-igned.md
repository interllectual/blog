<p>I am on a neverending quest to find an email client that doesn&#8217;t drive me bonkers.</p>

<p>I spend at least half my <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~bboard" title="HSU Blackboard Support">work</a> day dealing with email.  This is by design.  I am a support administrator for the faculty, and I prefer to work through email rather than on the phone.  That way, <em>I</em> can prioritize requests; the phone ringing usurps this system, giving all calls the same (high) priority.  Plus it drives me nuts.</p>

<p>So. I need an email client that can handle the job.  To me, this does not seem like too much to ask. What I require is:</p>

<ol>
<li><span class="caps">IMAP</span> capabilities.</li>
<li>Functional mail templates, including &#8220;Reply with Template&#8221;.  I send the same email responses repeatedly, and need to be able to do this quickly, but without it seeming like I&#8217;m sending off form letters.</li>
<li>Threaded messages.  I like to organize things into threads.  Real threads.  The kind that can be minimized and maximized.</li>
<li>Spell check. Prefereably inline.</li>
<li>Drag and drop moving of messages.  I manage three accounts and need to be able to easily transfer messages between them.</li>
<li>Free.  I work for the State of California.  Enough said.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have been switching clients about every two weeks for the last six months trying to find something that will work.  I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>&#8220;Apple&#8217;s Mail.app.&#8221;:http://www.apple.com/macosx/jaguar/mail.html</strong>  This does not support templates, but I have gotten around that by springing $10 of my own money on a nice little piece of shareware from <a href="http://abracode.com/">Abracode</a> , called <a href="http://www.abracode.com/MailTemplate/">MailTemplate</a> .  I&#8217;m very happy with this product, but I&#8217;m <strong>not</strong> happy about having to buy it.  It should be part of the package. Mail also can&#8217;t handle sophisticated threading, wich right now is its major fault for me.  I know this is promised for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/panther/mail.html">the version packaged with Panther</a>, but even after it&#8217;s released I have to convince work to pay for an OS upgrade before I can use it.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://mozilla.org/">Mozilla Mail</a> / <a href="http://mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> . </strong> In theory, I would love to use this product, but in practice, it&#8217;s just not working out.  The template support is not good enough.  There is no way to reply with a template&#8212; all template messages must be new messages.  This is not good for keeping threads, or for client relations.  Plus, the interface is just too chunky and unsophisticated for me.  I much prefer the aqua interface of Mail.app.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/entouragex/entouragex.aspx?pid=entouragex">Entourage.</a> </strong>I already had the Office X suite, so I thought I&#8217;d give this a try.  Talk about a chunky interface!  With this I can&#8217;t even drag messages to another account, which makes it completely useless.  Plus, I get tons of error messages because it can&#8217;t connect to the server, etc. I have a feeling this is probably due to bloated code that plagues all Office products. However, it does beat Mail.app on it&#8217;s threading, and Abracode has a good shareware template editor for this as well.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.gyazsquare.com/gyazmail/">GyazMail.</a> </strong> Looks like it would be an elegant app, but doesn&#8217;t support <span class="caps">IMAP</span>.  This prevents me from even really giving it a good evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<p>So lately, I&#8217;ve landed back on Mail.app and am dreaming of the day they do a better job with their threading.  But I am still largely unsatisfied, and prone to spending long hours scouring the web for something that will work out better.  Any suggestions would be most welcome&#8230;<br />
