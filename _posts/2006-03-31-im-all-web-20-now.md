<p>I just implemented a <a href="http://www.truist.com/blog/493/trutags-a-tagging-plugin-for-textpattern">kick ass plugin</a> that allows me to tag my articles and create on of those trendy tag clouds.</p>

<p>All joking aside, I have come to like tags much better than categories for organizing my thoughts.  Plus I always kind of hated the way the category listing looked&#8212; the tag cloud looks much better over there on the home page.  The danger becomes generating just too many tags for my own good, but we&#8217;ll see how it goes.  There may be some style/layout glitches while I fool around with the tags, so please be patient.</p>
