Random thoughts: "We built this city on Rock n' Roll". Voted the worst song ever. Created by poineering rock band in the mid stages of their career when rock n roll had moved past them.

Compare to: all the whining these days about the web we lost, and how we pioneers built this internet to be one thing and now it's turning into another.

Need to ponder more about this.
