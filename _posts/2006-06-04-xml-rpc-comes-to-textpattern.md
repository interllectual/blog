<p>There is now finally <a href="http://textpattern.com/download-rpc">a supported way to use <span class="caps">XML</span>-<span class="caps">RPC</span> with Textpattern</a>.  I am trying it out now&#8212; we&#8217;ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Edit: seems to be working well in Ecto, using the MetaWeblog <span class="caps">API</span>.  I had some issues with my time zone, so be sure to configure yours correctly in your client.</p>
