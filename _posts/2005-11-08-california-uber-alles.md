<p>On returning from my incredibly short vacation to Hawaii, I was greeted with freezing temperatures, unrelenting rain, darkness at about 4:30 thanks to the wonders of daylight savings time, and the realization that the budget situation at work is worse than I thought.</p>

<p>I was told that some stuff I though might be happening at work will definitely <span class="caps">NOT</span> be happening, due of course to financial issues.  I left work wondering how in the hell the state with an economy larger than that of most countries can have absolutely no money for education.</p>

<p>Then, <a href="http://kslg.com/"><span class="caps">KSLG</span></a> came to my rescue once again, by playing all four versions of the Dead Kennedys&#8217; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Uber_Alles">California Ãœber Alles</a> back to back.  Each one pays tribute to a different governor of California in a way only the Dead Kennedys can, from the 1979 original about <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/dead-kennedys/38152.html">Jerry Brown</a>, to the 1984 <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/dead-kennedys/38190.html">Ronald Reagan version</a>, to the 2005 <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/nofunatparties/438362.html">tribute to the Governator</a>.  But my personal favorite was the 1992 cover by The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy that <a href="http://www.hotlyrics.net/lyrics/D/Disposable_Heroes_Of_Hiphoprisy/California_Ueber_Alles.html">roasts Pete Wilson</a>, and contains the lines </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ll keep cuttin&#8217; Public Education <br />
even though we rank 45th in the nation </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds about right.</p>

<p>By the way, I recommend Dead Kennedy and/or Dead Milkmen therapy whenever possible.  When I finally got Brian an iPod last month, one of the first songs he bought was &#8220;Punk Rock Girl&#8221; as a surprise for me.  Ever since then, I have been looking for a way to work the following into a blog post, and it seems like a fitting ending to this one.  Make sure you yell it at the top of your lungs while you read it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you ain&#8217;t got Mojo Nixon<br />
Then this store could use some fixin&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh yeah, and I decided not to stop blogging.</p>
