summary: <p>I have been trying to find a good way to go about learning <span class="caps">DOM</span>-based scripting for several months now.  I have to say that it&#8217;s very hard to figure out where to start.</p>

<p>I am a little late to this conversation, but there has been some discussion lately about <a href="http://www.boxofchocolates.ca/archives/2005/04/03/browser-elitism" title="Part 1">browser</a> <a href="http://www.boxofchocolates.ca/archives/2005/04/19/browser-elitism-part-2" title="Part 2">elitism</a>, and how <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20050421185604.xml"><span class="caps">CSS</span> may be dipping its toes into waters best reserved for <span class="caps">DOM</span>-based scripting</a>.</p><p>I can agree with some of these arguments, and I have been trying to find a good way to go about learning <span class="caps">DOM</span>-based scripting for several months now.  I have to say that it&#8217;s very hard to figure out where to start.  There are a wealth of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/073571245X/qid=1116198608/sr=2-3/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_3/002-0008354-4532878" title="Eric Meyer on CSS">great</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735714258/qid=1116198608/sr=2-7/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_7/002-0008354-4532878" title="More Eric Meyer on CSS"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596005768/qid=1116198608/sr=2-6/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_6/002-0008354-4532878" title="CSS Cookbook">books</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0321303474/qid=1116198608/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-0008354-4532878?v=glance&#38;#38;s=books" title="The Zen of CSS Design">out</a> there for folks at every level of expertise, as well as more articles and <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com" title="CSS Zen Garden">demonstrations</a> than you can shake a stick at, but there is comparatively little good information to be found about scripting.  Just look at <a href="http://alistapart.com" title="A List Apart"><span class="caps">ALA</span></a>-- there are <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/topics/css/">62 <span class="caps">CSS</span> articles</a>, as opposed to <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/topics/dom/">26 <span class="caps">DOM</span> | Scripting articles</a>.   I&#8217;m sure this is reflective of a current bias in the web design industry, resulting from the &#8220;javascript is evil&#8221; days of yore.</p><p>On Amazon, I can find only a couple of books that mention the <span class="caps">DOM</span>, and they are from several years ago, except for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590595335/qid=1116197925/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/002-0008354-4532878?v=glance&#38;#38;s=books">one by Jeremy Keith that is not yet released</a>. I can find <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/resources/iotbs.html">some great tools</a> and <a href="http://brothercake.com/site/resources/scripts/">snippets of code</a> that use it, but it&#8217;s unclear how to get started in the right direction.  There is a lot of bad information about javascript out there, just like there is a lot of non-standards-based web design information.  But there is not as much guidance as to how to use <span class="caps">DOM</span> scripting responsibly, best practices, common pitfalls, etc. </p><p>So my question to the <span class="caps">DOM</span>-scripting gurus is: can you point us newbies to a good way to learn the basics so that we don&#8217;t have to learn responsible <span class="caps">DOM</span>-scripting by trial and error?</p>
