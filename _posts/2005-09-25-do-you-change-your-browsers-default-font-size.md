<p>At the risk of starting a font size holy war, I wanted to take a little survey about your browser&#8217;s default font size.</p>

<p>The first thing I do whenever I update or download a new browser is go into the preferences and change the default font size from 16px to 14px.  I don&#8217;t even think about it&#8212; it is a hard-wired behavior for me.</p>

<p>I started thinking about whether this affects my view of the web world.  I make sure my designs work at default font sizes, but after checking and verifying that things are acceptable that way, I am back to my world of smaller fonts, which are more comfortable for me.  However, I realize that the way I&#8217;m viewing the web may not be the way most folks are.  Most folks at my university, for example, use default sizes. </p>

<p>So I wanted to ask you all, do you change your browser&#8217;s default font size?  Why or why not?  And no flames, please.  If you didn&#8217;t know you <em>could</em> change your browsers default font size, you are as welcome here as everyone else, and please respond.</p>

<p>Also, I don&#8217;t want to get into what font size we should use in our designs. That is a different question that is likely to lead us down a path that is too murky and controversial for this sunny Saturday.</p>
