<ul>
<li>Someone brings Spam and crackers on a china plate, and a 40 oz bottle of Miller High Life (I am kicking myself for not getting a picture of this)</li>
<li>Some people (not you) actually <em>eat</em> some spam and crackers</li>
<li>You end up with more wine than you started with</li>
<li>The dog only growled at the right people</li>
<li>The kids didn&#8217;t break anything</li>
<li>It only took an hour to find the remote after the kids left</li>
<li>You didn&#8217;t have to spend the whole time pretending to eat one of the kids&#8217; toes (although he would have liked you to)</li>
<li>You end up with some leftovers you actually don&#8217;t mind eating</li>
<li>You have to stay home sick for the next two days, but <em>not</em> because you have a hangover</li>
<li>The house is still cleaner after the potluck than it was before you cleaned it <em>for</em> the potluck</li>
<li>Someone actually drank the rest of the generic grape soda you have been trying to pawn off at the potlucks for about 2 years</li>
<li>Anthony has a good time</li>
<li>Anthony <em>admits</em> he had a good time</li>
</ul>
