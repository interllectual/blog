<p>A &#8220;musical baton&#8221; has been passed to me by <a href="http://www.glendathegood.com/blog/">Glenda the Goodwitch</a>. Wow, this site&#8217;s first meme!</p>

<p><em>Edit: I felt compelled to write more after I got home from work (ahem).  Pacific time has its disadvantages.</em></p>

<p><strong>Total volume of music files on my computer:</strong> 3.88 GB (holy crap!  That&#8217;s a lot for someone in a music rut.)</p>

<p><strong>The last CD I bought was:</strong> A Ghost is Born by <a href="http://www.wilcoworld.net/">Wilco</a></p>

<p><strong>Song playing right now:</strong> The Milkman of Human Kindness by <a href="http://www.billybragg.co.uk/">Billy Bragg</a></p>

<p><strong>Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me:</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Ghost in You by Psychedelic Furs</strong><br />
<blockquote>Inside you the time moves and she don&#8217;t fade / The ghost in you, she don&#8217;t fade.</blockquote><br />
Reminds me of my grandmother, who committed suicide three years before I was born, and I feel is inside me <a href="http://interllectual.com/musings/4/doing-fine-finally">for various reasons</a></p>

<p>*Lovesong by <a href="http://www.thecure.com/">The Cure</a>*<br />
<blockquote>However far away<br />
However long I stay<br />
Whatever words I say<br />
I will always love you.</blockquote><br />
For all the friends from those days that I still love and never keep in touch with </p>

<p>*Closer to Fine by <a href="http://www.indigogirls.com/">The Indigo Girls</a>*<br />
<blockquote>I spent four years prostrate to the higher mind, got my papers, now I&#8217;m free</blockquote><br />
I spent eight years prostrate to the higher mind&#8230;</p>

<p>*Yin and Yang The Flowerpot Man by <a href="http://www.loveandrockets.org/">Love &#38; Rockets</a>*<br />
<blockquote>Beauty, beauty, beauty, beautiful&#8230;</blockquote><br />
High school nostalgia</p>

<p>*Who Loves the Sun by <a href="http://www.velvetunderground.com/">The Velvet Underground</a>*<br />
<blockquote>Not everyone.</blockquote><br />
Anthem for the dark days.</p>

<p>Yes, I am officially stuck in the 80&#8217;s.  But it&#8217;s the good 80&#8217;s.</p>

<p><strong>Five people to whom Iâ€™m passing the baton.</strong> I don&#8217;t know a lot of bloggers that haven&#8217;t already anted up, so I&#8217;ll pick some I know and some I&#8217;m just curious to hear from:</p>
