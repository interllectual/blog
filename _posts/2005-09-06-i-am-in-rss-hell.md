<p>Every so often, I come to a point in my life where I hate all my software.  This is one of those times.</p>

<p>It seems like all my apps are conspiring against me to make my life a fractured inefficient hell. While some <a href="http://www.lisamcmillan.com/journal/best-of-web-apps-edition" title="Lisa McMillan: Best Of. Web apps for web developers addition">love their web apps</a>, I tend to love/hate mine.  While the apps are useful, I hate having my data spread out all over the place.  </p>

<p>I work on two computers regularly (work and home), and you&#8217;d think that moving to web-based apps would help with my synchronization.  And it does, for the most part.  I use <a href="http://del.icio.us/asarbogast/">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://backpackit.com/">Backpack</a>, <a href="http://basecamphq.com/">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">FeedBurner</a>, <a href="http://gmail.com/">gmail</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/interllectual/">Flickr</a>, and while I can access all this stuff from wherever I am computer-wise, it still makes me feel disjointed and slightly schizophrenic.  And I need to have about 80 tabs open in my browser at all times.  And my two machines are on different operating systems, so my version of <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/">Saft</a> won&#8217;t work at home, but I digress.</p>

<p>What brings all these fractured apps together for me, is my use of <span class="caps">RSS</span> to keep track of it all.  Which leads me to the point of this post: I currently hate every <span class="caps">RSS</span> reader in production.</p>

<p>I own <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> and <a href="http://www.newsfirerss.com/">NewsFire</a>.  While they are both great products, I really would like something web based.  I am trying to simplify my life these days, and it seems like I shouldn&#8217;t need to have another app open just to read  my feeds, when I already have a browser open.  I <em>should</em> just be able to read my feeds from there. I always click through to a browser to read articles, and the switching back and forth between the reader and the browser is driving me nuts.  Plus synchronization across my machines is a chore.  <span class="caps">NNW</span> can synchronize, but the method is clunky and annoying. NF, while I love the simple interface, can&#8217;t synchronize at all.</p>

<p>I have tried <a href="http://bloglines.com">Bloglines</a>: too frickin&#8217; ugly.  This is shallow, I know, but I can&#8217;t stand looking at it.  </p>

<p>I have tried <a href="http://rojo.com">Rojo</a>: <del>this to me is the epitome of an app that was designed by men for men.</del> <ins>That part is stupid, and I take it back, see comments.</ins>  While the interface isn&#8217;t ugly, per se, it does nothing for me.  Also, it is too slow, in several ways.  It takes forever to refresh the display when you click on a certain feed, and articles show up <em>hours</em> after they have been published.  This would be OK if I used my feeds only to read blogs, but as I said above, I use them to keep track of all my data.  When my student assistant completes a project I set up for him and clicks &#8220;Done&#8221; in Backpack or Basecamp, I need to know right away.</p>

<p>I have tried <a href="http://kinja.com">Kinja</a>: it has the same problem as Rojo with feed being updated too slowly, and seemingly pretty randomly.  This is a shame, because Kinja currently has the interface I like the best.  Simple and to the point.</p>

<p>I was in love with <a href="http://feedness.com">Feedness</a> for all of Saturday, until I figured out that it is the slowest of them all in updating feeds, and it can&#8217;t understand the feeds from Backpack.  I was all ready to write a post about how all those years of Spanish came in handy after all. Rats.</p>

<p>So, what to do?  Currently, I am leaning toward NewsFire because it understands all my feeds, updates them reliably, and doesn&#8217;t have a lot of features I don&#8217;t need.  The synchronization is an issue, though.  I really would like something web based.</p>

<p>So what aggregator do you use?  Have I missed any worthy web-based readers?  I&#8217;m really hoping one of you can point me to a gem I&#8217;ve been missing&#8230;</p>
