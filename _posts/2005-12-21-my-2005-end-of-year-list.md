<p>In the tradition of <a href="http://interllectual.com/margarita/good-riddance-2003">Good Riddance 2003</a>, I&#8217;d like to take some time to point out the things I would like to <em>just end already</em> with the end of 2005. Here we go:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stupid little icons.  I&#8217;m sick of web sites that rely on icons.  Just do it with the typography already.</li>
<li>Bright plasticy looking design elements.  It&#8217;s been taken far enough.</li>
<li>Giant headers.  If you can&#8217;t fill up the space, just don&#8217;t post.</li>
<li>University sites designed using the school colors. I know this will never go away, but come on&#8212; there&#8217;s no way to make that look good.</li>
<li>Wicked worn&#8212; it&#8217;s worn out.</li>
<li>The <span class="caps">XHTML</span> / <span class="caps">HTML</span> debate.  I&#8217;m bored to tears thinking about it long enough to write this list item.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, you can tell how much I love the holiday hullaballoo, can&#8217;t you?  Well, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48714301@N00/75700336/in/set-1623771/">at least I got a gnome</a>, which is guarenteed to keep my spirits up this season.<br />
