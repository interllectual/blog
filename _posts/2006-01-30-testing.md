<p>Please ignore this.</p>

<p>Update: Man, Technorati is hella slow.  (That is the first time I have ever said &#8220;hella&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be doing it again.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to go do something more interesting for a while.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re really bored, you can look at my <a href="http://technorati.com/claim/af6f8nvfuq">Technorati Profile</a>, which has pretty much nothing in it, because I don&#8217;t really understand how it will benefit me to deal with Technorati.  Hence this stupid, pointless post.<br />
