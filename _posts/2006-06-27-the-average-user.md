<p>Zeldman says <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/2006/06/27/glue/">the average user was recently spotted in Northville, Michigan, purchasing 10 lbs. of potting soil and a garden hose</a>.  Seeing as that is the town I grew up in, I wonder if that average user was a relative of mine, or the high school teacher that introduced me to the internet back in 1989.  Or some old classmate that never got out.</p>
