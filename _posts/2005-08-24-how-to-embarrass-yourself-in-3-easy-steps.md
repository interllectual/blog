<li>Assume that no one, except for about 5 women that you know will cut you some slack, reads your site.</li>
<li>Launch a redesign on Sunday afternoon before it&#8217;s completely ready, just to get it up there and off your plate.</li>
<li>Happen to launch about the same time as the redesign of a <a href="http://alistapart.com">famous web zine</a> that uses Georgia much better than you do, and made sure they didn&#8217;t launch before they were ready.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am working on the IE issues.  I really am.  But I have a day job where I have to kiss IE&#8217;s ass far too much, and here on my personal site it gets to take a back seat.  This helps to keep me sane.  </p>

<p>Thank you so much to whoever submitted my site to <a href="http://cssbeauty.com"><span class="caps">CSSB</span>eauty</a>, and to those of you coming from there&#8212; welcome!  I am honored to be featured there, and slightly embarrassed.  I&#8217;m working on the IE issues.  I really am.</p>
