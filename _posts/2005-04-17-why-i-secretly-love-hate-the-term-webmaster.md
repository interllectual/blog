<p>The converstation goes something like this:</p><p>&#8220;This is my wife/friend Andrea.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Hi, nice to meet you.&#8221; </p><p>Shaking of hands.  He (because this only happens with men, why is that?) then asks, </p><p>&#8220;What do you do?&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the Web Manager for <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu"><span class="caps">HSU</span></a>. &#8220;</p><p>Blank look.  Gears of mind creaking as he tries to figure out what &#8220;Web Manager&#8221; means.  So I throw him a bone.</p><p>&#8220;Webmaster.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;  </p><p>Then he proceeds to mime out some kind of dominance scenario: karate chopping, whip cracking, etc, while he repeats the term,</p><p>&#8220;Webmaster!&#8221;</p><p>And I realize that I may as well be standing there in leather, fishnets, and a dog collar, because his mind instantly goes &#8220;<em>Webmaster&#8230;, but she&#8217;s blonde and a woman&#8230;, so that makes her a Web</em>*mistress!*&#8221;</p><p>And once the word &#8220;mistress&#8221; enters his mind, I may as well kiss all pretenses of being a serious career woman goodbye.  That is always the last question I get asked about my professional life.  Actually, that&#8217;s usually the last question I get asked at all.</p><p>One of these days I&#8217;m just going to snap, and when we get to this point, I&#8217;m going to yell,</p><p>&#8220;Get down on your knees an lick my boots!  Do it <em>now</em>!  I mean it, bitch!  Don&#8217;t give me that look!&#8221;</p><p>And it&#8217;s going to be some vice president, and I&#8217;m going to lose my job and have to put Google ads on this blog to try to eke out a living.</p><p>That term is bad for the career of every woman with a sense of humor.</p><h2>So what do I call myself?</h2><p>Well, at <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a> there were quite a few <a href="http://meyerweb.com" title="for example">principals</a> (not to mention <a href="http://www.clientside.com.au" title="for example">principles</a>), lots of <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal" title="for example">Dirs</a> and <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk" title="for example">Creative Dirs</a>, and quite possibly my favorite, Dir Web &#38; Creative Services.</p><p>Then of course, there&#8217;s <a href="http://molly.com">Molly</a>, who listed herself as &#8220;Pres&#8221;, but who gets by perfectly fine being known as just &#8220;Molly&#8221;.</p><p>So what do you think?  What&#8217;s the best title for someone who&#8217;s in charge of the whole University web site?  Some who works with a team of one, and so has to be designer, developer, manager and director?</p>
