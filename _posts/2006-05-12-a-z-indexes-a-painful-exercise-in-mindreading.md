<p>Hmmm.  Although our A-Z index does require a bit of mindreading, I think it is much more effective than is suggested <a href="http://www.iqcontent.com/publications/features/article_78/">in this article by Brian Donohue</a>.  This is probably because at Universities we are so focused on departments which have unambiguous names.  That is what is in the index, not references to pieces of content.</p>
