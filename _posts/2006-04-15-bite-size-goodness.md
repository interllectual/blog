<p>One of the projects I have been working long and hard on launched today: Introducing <a href="http://bitesizestandards.com">Bite Size Standards</a>.</p>

<p>The braindchild of <a href="http://joshuaink.com">John Oxton</a>, Bite Size Standards aims to offer concise web development tutorials, tips and tricks. I was in charge of the Textpattern inplementation, and had the pleasure of working with an awesome international team, including <a href="http://nidahas.com">Prabhath Sirisena</a>, <a href="http://akaxaka.gameover.com/">James Akaxaka</a>, <a href="http://www.pixeldiva.co.uk/">Ann McMeekin</a>, and <a href="http://andrewdisley.com/">Andrew Disley</a>. It was a great experience to work with such a diverse and talented team.  Many a debate was had along the way (Ann and James are master debaters, hee hee), and that was half the fun.</p>

<p>My first contribution is <a href="http://bitesizestandards.com/bites/take-time-to-tune-your-titles">Take time to tune your titles</a>.  Hopefully this will be the first of many.   This was also not your average Textpattern install, and I&#8217;m sure there will be an article or two about it showing up here about that, as well.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the site, and take away some helpful web standards nuggets.</p>
