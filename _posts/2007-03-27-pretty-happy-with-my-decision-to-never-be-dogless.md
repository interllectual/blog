<p>This weekend we drove 1000 miles to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/interllectual/434576464/">get a puppy</a>.</p>

<p>I think we got the best damn one. Anywhere.</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/interllectual/434578272/">Solstice is doing a great job passing the torch on to Lola</a>, and will be able to go in peace, knowing that Bri and I will have someone to make sure we take walks on the beach and spend at least a little time offline sometimes.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, Lola is sitting on my shoulder biting my nose, which is my cue to go frolic in meatspace for a while.</p>
