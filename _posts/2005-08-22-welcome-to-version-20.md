<p>Grab a cup and have a drink&#8212; this is version 2.0.</p>

<p>If things look wacky, try clicking reload.</p>

<p>If they still look wacky and you&#8217;re using Firefox, you may have to choose View &#62; Page style &#62; Okapi. I&#8217;m not sure why this stylesheet isn&#8217;t loading by default for me in Firefox&#8212; I&#8217;m trying to figure that out. <strong>Update:</strong> this is fixed.</p>

<p>If they still look wacky and you&#8217;re using Internet Explorer, sorry about that. That is tomorrow&#8217;s project. I will fix things for you, I promise.</p>

<p>This version is all about information architecture&#8212;hopefully weâ€™ll all be able to find what we&#8217;re looking for now. It&#8217;s also all about drinking, and how different beverages play a role in my life.</p>

<p>Professional posts will be under &#8220;Coffee at my desk&#8221;&#8212; serious, no-nonsense stuff that you may need caffeine to get through. &#8220;Cocoa on the Couch&#8221; is all the personal stuff&#8212;sometimes sweet, sometimes bitter, and it&#8217;s good to have a fire going and a cat purring in your lap when you read these. Then there&#8217;s my favorite, &#8220;Margarita on the Rocks&#8221;. This section contains all the rants, most of the profanity, and most of the fun stuff. It&#8217;s the kind of stuff we would talk about if we went out to the bar for a drink. I may be full of crap when I post things here, so take it with a grain of salt (get it?).</p>

<p>Why is this particular post under Cocoa? Because the cat is purring in my lap right now and I&#8217;m still in my pajamas. I will be transitioning to the margaritas soon. Hope you enjoy the new place.</p>

<p>Update: Forgot&#8212; you may need to update your feeds&#8212; new feeds explained here.</p>

<p>Update 2: Things should be usable in IE PC now. I am having major png issues, however, so there&#8217;s a lot more grey than there should be.</p>
