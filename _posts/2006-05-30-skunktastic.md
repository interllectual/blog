<p>It is with great pleasure and great sadness that I announce the retirement of one of Interllectual&#8217;s dearest friends.</p>

<p>The spotted skunk is officially removed from the list of animals I want to see in their natural habitat, because I saw one this morning.  Which means that if I&#8217;m going to keep following my own rules, the spotted skunk theme for this site will have to go.  This is a bit of a bummer, since he has been the favorite of many.  And also because he is one of the two themes I actually made for this recent incarnation of the site.  So, to give him good sendoff and to give me some time to get another theme ready, I have switched the default theme from Okapi to Spotted Skunk for about a week or so.  If the change didn&#8217;t work for you, you can reset the cookie by choosing the skunk <a href="http://interllectual.com/animal">over on the themes page</a>.</p>

<p style="clear:both">As for what will replace the skunk, I&#8217;m not yet sure.  The most likely candidate, the ringtail, is also out of the running, because I saw one of them this morning, too.  It has been one of the best 24 hours in the field I have ever had, and I&#8217;m glad I decided to go meet up with Brian and his class on the spur of the moment.  I joked with him that to get me to go he would have to deliver a spotted skunk and a ringtail.  I&#8217;ll be damned if he didn&#8217;t comply.  I have tried to see these two critters for at least 5 years, and kept missing them.  It was worth the wait though.  We got great looks at them and some great footage, of which the photos of mine that I&#8217;m showing here are the worst.  There is video and some better pics that I&#8217;ll have my hands on soon.</p>
