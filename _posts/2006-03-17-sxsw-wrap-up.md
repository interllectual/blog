<p>Still trying to process my thoughts on this year&#8217;s conference.  It was great, in a totally different way than last year&#8217;s conference.  I met so many more folks this year, which was a good thing for me, but was also a lot of work.  Last year I focused more on the panels and less on the networking, but still managed to get a ton of inspiration and a few great friends out of it.  This year I had many more conversations with many more folks, but most of them were only a few minutes long.  We&#8217;ll see how many of these turn in to great friendships, but there are a few that I hope will.</p>

<h2>The Requisite Namedropping</h2>

<p>Here are the folks I met up with, in alphabetical order: <a href="http://andybudd.com/">Andy</a>, <a href="http://antonpeck.com">Anton</a>, <a href="http://www.du.edu/">Chip</a>, <a href="http://waffle.clientside.net.au">Chris</a>, <a href="http://www.designrabbit.com/">Cindy</a>, <a href="http://focalcurve.com">Craig</a>, <a href="http://blog.fatbusinessman.com/">David</a>, <a href="http://boxofchocolates.ca/">Derek</a>, <a href="http://epersonae.com">Elaine</a>, <a href="http://ellythompson.com/">Elly</a>, <a href="http://meyerweb.com">Eric</a>, <a href="http://kurafire.net/">Faruk</a>, <a href="http://glendathegood.com">Glenda</a>, Geert, <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason</a>, <a href="http://adactio.com">Jeremy</a>, <a href="http://hicksdesign.co.uk">Jon</a>, <a href="http://snook.ca">Jonathan</a>,  Kenneth, Matt from UT, <a href="http://usabilityworks.typepad.com/">Matthew</a>, <a href="http://blog.meriwilliams.com/">Meri</a>, <a href="http://patrickhaney.com/">Patrick</a>, <a href="http://www.sinkingships.net">Rob</a>, <a href="http://www.robweychert.com/">Rob</a>, <a href="http://fozzy.csuchico.edu/wordpress/">Scott</a>, <a href="http://nascentguruism.com">Steve</a>, <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/">Veerle</a>, <a href="http://yvonneadams.com/">Yvonne</a>, and <a href="http://zachinglis.com/">Zach</a>. If I missed you, don&#8217;t take it personally&#8212; it is all still a blur.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Moments</h2>

<p>The real gems happened away from the conference: tapas with Chris, watching bats with Glenda and Rob, giving some Humboldt Fog to Jon.  There was also when Jeremy sat next to me during a panel and then told me he liked my site afterwords.  And that vision of Rob going up the escalator to the Web Awards will stay with me for a while.  I pretty sure I told Jason I thought his shoes were lickable, too. Plus, there were about 50 hugs from Faruk, a great conversation with Veerle, and Anton gave me an awesome bird illustration.  I think I may have learned some stuff, too.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#8217;d say it was a success.  I have <a href="http://interllectual.com/margarita/that-post-conference-buzz">that post-conference buzz</a> again, and have tons of ideas of things I want to do.  Hopefully this will all lead to a burst of productivity.  For now, I&#8217;m going to focus on catching up on my sleep&#8230; That&#8217;s one thing I didn&#8217;t do too much of.</p>
