<p>I am <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com">booked</a>, and registered at the Hilton.  Doing it in style this time.</p>

<p>The newly posted <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/">panel schedule</a> looks interesting, especially this one: &#8220;Why Are Women Invisible on the Web: Whose Butts Should We be Kicking?&#8221;.  While I like to kick ass as much as the next punk rock girl, I wonder if the answer isn&#8217;t &#8220;our own&#8221;.</p>

<p>And look, boss, there is also &#8220;The Future of Education in a Digitally Convergent World&#8221;, &#8220;Serious Games for Learning&#8221;, &#8220;Web Standards and Search Engines: Searching for Common Ground&#8221; (an issue of late), and a session by Peter Moreville, who is the mentor of a friend of mine and I&#8217;ve always wanted to hear speak.  Plus a great group of .edu folks, standardistas, and party animals that I know are also attending.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t wait!</p>
