<p>The Poynter Institute published a <a href="http://www.poynterextra.org/eyetrack2004/main.htm">fascinating eye-tracking study</a> last week, that shows how users see and use news sites.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to see some actual research done on this&#8212; it&#8217;s commonly understood that readers look at the top left of the page first, but these are the first actual numbers I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.poynterextra.org/eyetrack2004/fontsize.htm">part about text size</a> is interesting&#8212; people tend to scan pages with larger type and read pages with smaller type more carefully.  Also the larger the size disparity between a headline and a blurb, the less likely the readers were to read the blurb.</p>

<p>There is a lot more there that I haven&#8217;t digested yet.  It&#8217;s nice to see science meet the web, though, especially for this ex-scientist.<br />
