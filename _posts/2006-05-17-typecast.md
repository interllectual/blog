<p>I decided it was time to change the Interllectual logo type&#8212; I&#8217;m just not feeling deco anymore.  So I searched through the more than 5000 fonts I have (l <em>love</em> being in a Graphic Services department&#8230;) and pulled out my favorites.  The one I liked best turned out to be Cheltenham bold condensed.  Exactly the same font I used on <a href="http://janglyganglia.com">Jangly Ganglia</a>.  I am in a rut.</p>
