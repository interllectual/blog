<p>We got the green light to launch our new University web site  mid-August.  Some people aren&#8217;t going to like it, because they are not our target audience, and I&#8217;m done trying to please everybody.</p>

<p>So, these <a href="http://newsweaver.ie/gerrymcgovern/e_article000595713.cfm">words from Gerry McGovern</a> may come in handy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Great web management starts off with allowing the most important customers complete their most important tasks as quickly and simply as possible. Poor web management plays politics by giving a little of the homepage to every department. Poor web management tries to answer every question</p>
