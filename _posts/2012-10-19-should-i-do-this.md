I am kind of intrigued with this flat-file CMS thing. I am all for simplifying the writing experience. Of course, there are still things to learn, and some setup and design to do. 

I am thinking that it may be a good thing for me to start writing more. That, or therapy. Wondering if this would be a way for me to do so easily, and keep some things private, if needed.
