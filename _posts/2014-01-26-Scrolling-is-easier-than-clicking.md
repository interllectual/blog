>And for some reason there is a myth about users not scrolling. It’s a very old myth…and it must have come about around the same time as the “above the fold” myth. This is bunk. If you need evidence just look around. The evidence is everywhere. Simply watch any human being using a mobile or tablet device. People scroll so much you could almost say that they scroll more than they don’t.
