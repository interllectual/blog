<p>Help!  I&#8217;ve agreed to speak on a panel at a local Technology Expo called <em>Future Tech Forum:  Tech Leaders Discuss the Future of Technology on the Northcoast.</em>  </p>

<p>After spending way too long this weekend trying to install Tiger (it&#8217;s pretty hard to use an install <span class="caps">DVD</span> when you have no <span class="caps">DVD</span> drive. Too bad I didn&#8217;t realize that when I pre-ordered my copy&#8230;), I&#8217;m feeling like this may not really be my area of expertise.  Couple that with my irrational fear of public speaking, and this is shaping up to be a disaster.</p>

<p>So, if you were going to speak to a group that will be made up of about 50% high-school students and 50% other folks about the future of technology, what would you speak about?  And what do <em>you</em> think will be the wave of the future?</p>
