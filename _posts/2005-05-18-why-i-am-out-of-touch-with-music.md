<p>As a follow-up to the <a href="http://interllectual.com/musings/245/a-musical-baton">musical baton going through my hands</a>, I thought I should share how I lost touch with music.</p>

<p>I used to be totally into music&#8212; going to shows, buying new stuff as it came out, listening to obscure radio stations to hear the newest, most innovative tunes.  Then, in 1994, I dropped out of society.  Having just graduated from college, I went off to be a field hand for biologist studying <a href="http://www.oceanfootage.com/stockfootage/Masked+Booby////?DVfSESSCKIE=2d584a4b56372f81a18d9029e20127e383cf9d34" title="video clips of the Masked Booby, my study animal">sea birds in the Gal√°pagos Islands</a>.</p>

<p>It was an opportunity of a lifetime&#8212; the chance to work hands-on with birds that have no fear of humans whatsoever, an all-expense-paid trip to the Gal·pagos, and some really high-profile biological research.  </p>

<p>So I found myself living on an uninhabited island on the Equator, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  There were 5 other people there with me.  We were stocked by supply boats that came 1000 miles from Ecuador once every 2-3 months&#8212; we drank rainwater, ate canned food, and used candles to see when it got dark.</p>

<p>I was there 8 months the first time, then decided to expand my work into a Master&#8217;s degree. So I went back for 5 more months within a year, and then back for 1 more month about a year later.  All told, I lived for 14 months in a tent and had only the music I could bring with me.  This was 1994-6, so my source was cassette tapes and a walkman.  I hopelessly lost touch with music while I was on that island, and I haven&#8217;t been able to catch up since.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not complaining&#8212; I got in touch with a lot of other aspects of life during that time.  Sometimes I just miss the music.</p>

<p>Here are some photos of my living quarters, so you can start to grasp what I&#8217;m talking about.  Click the photos to go to Flickr and see notes about what they contain.</p>
