> In the aftermath of a horrific tragedy such as the Boston Marathon terror attack Monday, dogs are a reliable source of comfort. Bomb-sniffing dogs have been working around the clock with officers in Boston, responding to calls from frightened citizens reporting suspicious packages. They're also working in other cities around the country, where security has been tightened. The Lutheran Church Charities' K-9 Parish Comfort Dogs will be heading to Boston soon as well. The golden retrievers were brought to Newtown, Conn., to provide comfort to people of the community after the shootings. "Dogs are nonjudgmental. They are loving. They are accepting of anyone. It creates the atmosphere for people to share," said church president Tim Hetzner. [Source]
