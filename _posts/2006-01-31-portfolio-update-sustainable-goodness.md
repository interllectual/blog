<p>My latest project has launched: a family of sites for Ag Innovations Network, an organization that works toward real solutions to sustainable agriculture.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t express how fun it was to work on this project&#8212; I got to learn about an interesting and worthy non-profit, design with luscious photos of food, and push my Textpattern-foo even further.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://aginnovations.net">Ag Innovations Network site</a> highlights the mission and services of the organization, and will contain articles about sustainable ag issues. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://agfuturesalliance.net">Ag Futures Alliance site</a>  features a separate section for each county the organization works with, and is built to expand to accommodate up to 15 counties in the future. Each county section has a unique graphic header that features a major agricultural product of the county.</p>

<p>Both sites use <a href="http://textpattern.com">Textpattern</a> as <span class="caps">CMS</span> to allow clients to easily update and maintain the content.</p>

<p>Check the sites out if you&#8217;re interested in seeing what I&#8217;ve been doing in my spare time.</p>

<p>A major upgrade of my Portfolio section is in the works&#8212; I have launched to many <span class="caps">HSU</span> sites in the last year that I have gotten behind in adding them here.</p>
