<p>Ok, I&#8217;m going to start posting more regularly now.</p><p>I spent yesterday hooking up a router and upgrading Bri&#8217;s laptop to OS X so that we can have a wireless connection.  This is supposed to enable us to at least stay in the same room with each other while we&#8217;re online/working.  We&#8217;ll see how it goes.  At least it doesn&#8217;t seem quite as antisocial.</p><p>I am working on the gallery that I promised, and I have some real gems.  Just got to get the backend set up, so that all of you can participate in <a href="http://interllectual.com/article/19/">my biggest pet-peeve</a>.  I know you can&#8217;t wait.</p><p>Formatting is still a bit off in the comments and article pages, and the design&#8217;s not quite done overall, but i need to get posting or else this blog will die like the last one.  So, it will all come together eventually.</p>
