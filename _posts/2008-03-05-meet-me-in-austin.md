<p>I am leaving bright and early tomorrow morning (like at 4am, sheesh) to attend my 4th <span class="caps">SXSW</span>. I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting out of Dodge for a while, and I really need the shot in the arm that I always get from hanging out with all the geeks, seeing old friends, and meeting new ones. If you will be there, look me up and say hi. I will have some kick-ass Interllectual Moo cards &#8212; get &#8216;em while they last!</p>

<p>If you really want to track me down, you can <a href="http://sched.org/sxsw2008/interllectual">see my schedule on sched.org</a>, the schedule service the <span class="caps">SXSW</span> should have created, but didn&#8217;t. I am also going to be speaking on an <a href="http://usabilityworks.org/2008/03/03/sxsw-2008-you-unpanel-awaits/">Unpanel</a>, the creation of <a href="http://usabilityworks.org/">Matthew Oliphant</a>. This will be my first foray into <span class="caps">SXSW</span> speaking&#8212; I will probably talk about our epic accessibility pursuits at Humboldt State, but may speak about some other topic related to Higher Ed web design/development. I am excited and slightly terrified, but I decided that I need to start kicking my fear of public speaking somehow. Details on the where and when of the Unpanel will be coming soon.</p>
