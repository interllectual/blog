summary: <p>I&#8217;m probably the only one at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> that is taking this time to blog about something totally different.  I&#8217;ve got the obligatory <span class="caps">SXSW</span> post brewing but for now, I&#8217;m going to point out something that is likely to have just as big of an impression on me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m probably the only one at <span class="caps">SXSW</span> that is taking this time to blog about something totally different.

<p>Jess is working at a gallery that is opening on Saturday.  The inagural show is a collection of Warhol prints that have never been shown and were never meant to be shown&#8212; they were made as gifts or trial proofs, etc.  I went with her on Saturday morning before Zeldman&#8217;s opening to the frame shop that had the prints, so she could take some digital photos of a couple of them to promote the show.</p>

<p>So I got to see a newly framed <a href="http://www.hamiltonselway.com/warhol_trials/chocolate_bunny.htm">chocolate bunny</a>, an unframed study of Muhammad Ali&#8217;s fist, and an unframed trial proof of his <a href="http://www.augengallery.com/Prints/Warhol/fish_wallpaper.htm">fish wallpaper</a>.  The fish wallpaper was large and on very thin paper, and Jess had a hard time keeping it from rolling back up on itself.  So she had me and the frame guy hold it open for her while she took the photo.  I will be posting the photo here of my hands holding open the Warhol print that has never been shown before, but I couldn&#8217;t wait any longer to make this post and rub it in.</p>

<p>What does it say about me that what I wanted to do <em>really badly</em> was stick my face right into the print and smell it?  I didn&#8217;t, but I wanted to.  And I could have.  But I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I was wearing gloves by the way, but I still touched a Warhol.</p>
