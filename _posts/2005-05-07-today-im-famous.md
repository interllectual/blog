<p>I spent this morning <a href="http://interllectual.com/musings/229/whats-the-future-of-technology">speaking on a panel at a local technology forum</a>, and achieving a slightly unsettling expert status among local high school students.  It actually turned out to be great fun, with lots of interesting questions and perspectives.  I was a good 10 years younger than the others on the panel, which gave me a kind of street cred with the audience.  That, and I didn&#8217;t wear a suit.</p><p>I made my way back into work to find that <a href="http://collegewebeditor.com/blog/index.php/archives/2005/05/06/interview-andrea-schwandt-arbogast-humboldt-state-universitys-web-manager/">my interview</a> with Karine from <a href="http://collegeweditor.com">collegeweditor.com</a> had been published.  So now I am experiencing high blog traffic (for me, anyway).  Welcome, new readers!</p><p>An update on the status of Part 3 of <em>Why Most University Web Sites Suck</em>: it is in the works.  Some turmoil at work and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87949960@N00/10189199/">my dog</a> getting surgery has set me back a bit. I was hoping to get it out before the interview, but sometimes life just happens. Things are moving forward now.  Expect it in a week or two.</p>
