<p>I feel like I write posts like this all the time, but it&#8217;s part of the process for me.</p>

<p>I am just now coming out of a major depressive episode that started sometime in March, before I went to <span class="caps">SXSW</span>.  I haven&#8217;t been able to do much writing since then, and I&#8217;ve been a bad friend and family member as well.  I owe apologies to a bunch of folks that I should have been keeping in better touch with: Jess especially, but also some others in places like Australia and England.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to go on much more about all this, I have other places where I will do that.  So instead I will fill y&#8217;all in on some of the major happenings that I haven&#8217;t reported.</p>

<p>First, the tickets for my trip to Australia are bought.  I will be there from January 15 to February 28, flying into Melbourne (which you have to pronounce Mel-burn or you&#8217;ll sound like a Gringo) and leaving from Sydney.  We&#8217;ll be in Melbourne for about 2 weeks or so while Brian works on a research project on <a href="http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Petauroides_volans.html">greater gliders</a>, and then spending the rest of the time traveling. Not sure of the whole agenda yet, but we&#8217;ll be spending some time in Tasmania and the Great Barrier Reef.</p>

<p>Which leads me to say that I&#8217;m much more sad about the fate of the Crocodile Hunter than I thought I would be.  The guy was annoying and flamboyant, but you can&#8217;t argue that he was a genuine animal lover.  And the conservation movement has lost an important player.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu">project</a> that I have been spending the last 6 months or so working on launched to surprisingly good reviews, despite unprecedented amounts of stress.  And we also just launched <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~swp">two</a> <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~ocn">new</a> department sites, a <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/firstyear">program</a> site, and a <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~humboldt/explore">virtual tour</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still working on a retooling of this site to make it easier for me to add new animal themes.  I still need to replace the skunk.  I am thinking about going with an all Australian animal theme, if I can get things set up before I leave.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s more that I missed, like Brian getting tenure and other milestones that have passed in the last six months&#8212; I&#8217;ll just have to let those go an once again start over.  If I owe you an email, I&#8217;m sorry, but I had to move everything to the archives to be able to face the inbox.  I&#8217;m back on top of things now, so I should be a better correspondent.</p>
