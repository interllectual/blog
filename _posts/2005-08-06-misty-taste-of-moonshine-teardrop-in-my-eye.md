<p>Yes, I&#8217;m on the road again&#8212; not taking the country roads this time, but leaving on a jet plane to go fill up my senses with the Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah river.  I&#8217;ll probably be staying on grandma&#8217;s feather bed and when the sun’s comin’ up there&#8217;ll be cakes on the griddle.  How may John Denver references can <em>you</em> fit into one paragraph?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m off to West-by-god-Virginia for a week to visit Brian&#8217;s family, and then dropping by my old haunts in Michigan for about 36 hours or so on the way back to go to a wedding.  My plans while I&#8217;m there include doing a lot of writing, so hopefully I&#8217;ll have some new material when I get back.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try to post photos on Flickr while I&#8217;m there, to give you all the WV experience.  Animals on the to-see list include: indigo bunting, black bear, red fox, white tailed deer (these are guaranteed, since Bri&#8217;s dad feeds them), Eastern bluebird, <span class="caps">FIREFLIES</span> which I&#8217;m having a hard time doing without here in the west, striped skunk, beaver, muskrat, groundhog, cardinal, blue jay, porcupine, maybe some nuthatches and flycatchers.  We&#8217;ll see how we do.</p>

<p>Have a good week!</p>
