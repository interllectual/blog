<p>I am about to embark on a project that to me seems a little hard to grasp: blogging at work, as part of my job.  I am so used to blogging being a personal project that I go to great efforts to distinctly separate from my work life, that I have a feeling it will be difficult to switch gears.</p>

<p>We have recently decided to increase the avenues of communication between the Web Office and the rest of the university, so folks have a better idea of what we&#8217;re working on and a way to give feedback.  This naturally lends itself to a Web Office blog.  We haven&#8217;t gone this route before, because while &#8220;Web Office&#8221; is a nice optimistic name, ours consists of one person: me.  We always figured it was more efficient for me to do work than to talk about doing work.  This, however, is not always the case.</p>

<p>So, the Web Office blog will be born in the next couple of weeks.  This concept is not a new one&#8212; I have seen several work blogs, and some blogs used to communicate about specific projects, such as <a href="http://www.osu.edu/redesign/?&#38;#38;blogid=1">Ohio State&#8217;s Redesign Blog</a> and <a href="http://blog.web.arizona.edu/">A New Arizona.edu</a>.  </p>

<p>I have a few questions for those of you that have experience with work blogs, and for those of you like me who may be contemplating setting one up for the fist time.</p>

<ol>
<li>How much time do you devote to keeping up your work blog?</li>
<li>Do you find that your work blog is worth the effort?</li>
<li>Do you allow comments, and if so do you moderate them? Do you allow anonymous comments?</li>
<li>Have you had as much participation from the campus as you anticipated?</li>
<li>How did you get the word out about your blog?</li>
</ol>

<p>Any other insight or thoughts that you have are welcome, as well.</p>
