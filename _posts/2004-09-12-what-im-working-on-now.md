<p>Just got this beta up Friday for <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~gamma/admday.html">Freshmen Admissions Day</a>. For some reason, I&#8217;m really digging this site.</p><p>Maybe because it came together so fast&#8212; about 1 day from concept to fully browser-tested templates.  Content will go in Monday, and we should be able to launch this baby by Wednesday at the latest.</p>
