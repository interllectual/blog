<p>Haven&#8217;t posted in a while.  Last month was crazy for me, as Brian had a scare with his health, and I am applying for a new job.  Added to that, we had the family over for Thanksgiving, a sick cat, and the brakes going out on the car.</p>

<p>But the main reason is that during a family trip to New York all the girls in my family finally fessed up about what we&#8217;ve never been able to discuss before&#8212; <a href="http://www.doingfine.org/blog/archives/000003.html">my grandmother&#8217;s death</a> and the effects it has had on all of us.  This conversation sparked a bout of depression that I am just now recovering from. </p>

<p>Brian saw the doctor yesterday, and he is fine, with is a big relief.  It takes a toll to live in fear that the cancer will come back.  We are both still trying to deal with this and to really believe that he is OK now.</p>
