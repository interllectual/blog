<p>This should not be a surprise to those of you that know me.  After all, the tag line of this site is &#8220;Where redesign is the new black&#8221;.</p>

<p>Today I came back from a week away from the blogosphere (which I highly recommend)&#8212; imagine my suprise when I saw a bunch of folks visiting this site from <a href="http://www.shauninman.com/plete/2005/06/overwhelming-response">shauninman.com</a>.  Actually, &#8220;surprise&#8221; is an understatement&#8212; I was practically shitting myself.</p>

<p>It seems that Jani, who I don&#8217;t know and didn&#8217;t pay anything to for this (I will, however, buy you your drink of choice should we ever meet), linked to my site as a design different from Shaun&#8217;s but pleasing. [<strong>Edit:</strong> for the record, I really like his redesign, and I envy his skills in design, javascript and flash.  The aesthetic aspect isn&#8217;t my cup-o-tea, but the quality of the features and execution of the design make his site a favorite of mine.]   There followed some critique, which is nice to finally get from the web design community.  Some comments were right on, and I totally agree with them&#8212; these comments stated that the site is hard to navigate, and it&#8217;s difficult to tell where to begin.  </p>

<p>I have been thinking this lately as well.  The confusion happened as a result of this site suddenly having information, and therefore needing information architecture.  I have been writing a lot more lately, and about a lot of diverse topics.  I didn&#8217;t have the backend sufficiently thought out, and it didn&#8217;t accommodate this radical change in my behavior. It is hard even for me to find things I&#8217;m looking for.</p>

<p>Other comments are personal opinion&#8212; the site is busy and overloaded with color.  This is true, and it was done on purpose.  Every time I redesign this site, I try to challenge conventions and my own design abilities.  I thought sites were becoming too monochromatic and sparse&#8212; I wanted to see if I could pull off a design that went in the opposite direction.  This is the place for me to do that, since experimenting with client work is not always such a good idea.</p>

<p>The only comment I have issue with is one that stated that this site is a little cliche.  To that I have this to say: gradients, plastic-y buttons, little pixely icons, wicked worn, whitespace with grey type and a punch of color, repeating <a href="http://squidfingers.com">squidfingers-esque</a> backgrounds&#8212; these are the design elements I consider cliche right now, and which I deliberately avoided using.  I kind of like rounded rectangles and <a href="http://interllectual.com/article/220/rounded-rectangles-resurrected-and-the-virtues-of">used them extensively</a>-, which could definitely be considered cliche, but I haven&#8217;t seen them used in such an asymmetric way before. I got suckered into a drop shadow by my own insecurities at the last minute.  I can tell that no one spent enough time to tell whether or not my writing is cliche.  So say you don&#8217;t like the design, that it&#8217;s not well-done, that its ugly, that it&#8217;s not working&#8212; anything but that its cliche.</p>

<p>So, I am thinking about a redesign to address the information architecture issues.  Things that will not be going away:</p>

<ul>
<li>the animals.  <a href="/animal">These have an important meaning to me</a>. (Although I&#8217;m considering retiring the wood duck, because for some reason I hate that color scheme)</li>
<li>the colors. I consider this part of the animals, as <a href="/animal">all the colors come directly from the critters</a>.</li>
<li>the meters.  These help keep me sane, and I love it how Steve always knows the exact numbers whenever I see him.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would be great to get some <strong>constructive</strong> criticism from you folks, as well.  What about this site works?  What doesn&#8217;t work?  What would make it more useful to you (besides better writing&#8212; I don&#8217;t know if I can do much about that&#8230;)?</p>
