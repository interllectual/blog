<p>In the last couple of days I have soft-launched version 4 of Interllectual.com. Any craziness you have been seeing with the <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds should be resolved now.</p>

<p>My goal with this version was to bring all the different aspects of my life together in one place, and to have the site feel like it represents where I am in my life at this point. Colors are brighter that they were before, and animals play a huge part in the site as they do in my life. There is a new logo-mascot, and my mammal and bird life-lists are a major feature. I have a backlog of data to fill in to the animal section, which is my favorite part of the new site. Brian and I spend a lot of time bird and mammal watching, and now we have a place to record what we&#8217;ve seen and to feature photos and videos we&#8217;ve taken of the critters. I have a bunch of videos from Australia that will be going up soon.</p>

<p>I also have a lifestream (the Diversions section) that pulls in my data from my other online forays&#8212; my tweets, links, books I&#8217;m currently reading, etc. And of course there are also the articles which I plan to devote a bit more time to in the near future.</p>

<p>The site is now running on <a href="http://expressionengine.com">ExpressionEngine</a>, and I will write more about that soon. I still have a bit of work to do with some of the finer details and the IE6 compatibility, but I wanted to get the site out there and let everyone start enjoying it. I call this version &#8220;Finnegan&#8221;, which is the name of the owl. I&#8217;ve always wanted to name one of my pets Finnegan, and now I have. Finny is wise and shares his wisdom with us all in his &#8220;Thought of the Day&#8221; in the footer of the main page.</p>

<p>Enjoy. </p>
