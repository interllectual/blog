<h2>Some Shameless Self-Promotion</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://webstandards.org">Web Standards Project&#8217;s</a> Education Task Force has listed <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu">Humboldt State University&#8217;s web site</a> as <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/campaign/edutf/resources.html#exampleSites">an excellent example of a standards-based edu site</a>.  I have since fixed the minor validation errors they mention, which were caused by my inexpert use of Textile in a couple of pages.</p>

<p>This is an honor for which I can take full credit&#8212; I often let my student assistants code out the projects and write the <span class="caps">CSS</span> to develop their skills, but this project was pulled off before I even <em>had</em> the luxury of a student assistant. So every line of it is mine, all mine! I talked about the redesign of <span class="caps">HSU</span>&#8217;s site on <a href="http://collegewebeditor.com/blog/index.php/archives/2005/05/06/interview-andrea-schwandt-arbogast-humboldt-state-universitys-web-manager/">collegewebeditor.com</a> if you&#8217;re interested in more details. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to have my work up there next to some sites that have the benefit of <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/credits/index.cfm">large web teams</a> or the budget to <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000049.html">hire well-known designers</a>, even if it is buried in the bowels of the WaSP site.</p>

<h2>How Can the WaSP Help Us? </h2>

<p>In the email they sent telling me they were linking to <span class="caps">HSU</span>, the Education Task Force asked me to let them know if I had any ideas about how they could further assist higher ed to incorporate web standards into its public sites and curriculum. So I want to pass this question on to all of you&#8212; they want to help us, let&#8217;s let them know how!</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/campaign/edutf/">mission of the Education Task Force</a>.  They are a relatively new group, and they are exploring ways to further their cause.  What advice can you give them?  How can they help us?</p>

<p>Also, which other <del>university</del> <ins>higher ed</ins> sites should be <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/act/campaign/edutf/resources.html#exampleSites">added to the list</a>?  I know there are more standards-based university sites out there than these.</p>
