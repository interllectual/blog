<p>Last night, I choked on a french fry.  Literally.  Brian had to give me he <a href="http://www.heimlichinstitute.org/howtodo.html">Heimlich Maneuver</a> three times before I could breathe again.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have much else to say about the whole thing, except that I don&#8217;t recommend it.  I didn&#8217;t have any profound life-flashing-before my eyes or go-toward-the-light moments.  It all happened so fast there was no time for any of that.  </p>

<p>I am grateful for whoever it was that taught Brian and I the Heimlich Maneuver&#8212; I have a feeling it must have been in Health class in elementary school, so I guess that wasn&#8217;t as useless as I thought it was.  And I am also grateful that I still have a chance to die in a more dignified way than choking on crappy fried food.  Ok,  they were actually good french fries, but still.</p>
