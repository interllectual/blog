<p>Every time I get linked to by a gallery site I am mortally embarrassed by that stupid little piece of white border and shadow that is always out of place in Safari. So, after <a href="http://www.designmeltdown.com/chapters/Columns/Part2.aspx">the latest one</a> that clearly shows my little nemesis, I think it is time for a <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/interllectual/205816936/">sneak peek</a> at my realign coming soon&#8212; as soon as I can get the stupid corners on the fixed position comment form to behave in&#8230; Safari.</p>
