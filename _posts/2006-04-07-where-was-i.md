<h2>One Year Ago</h2>

<p>April 06, 2005 I wrote <a href="http://interllectual.com/margarita/words-all-fail-the-magic-prize">this</a>, which is still one of my favorite posts ever.  I was still riding high from my first trip to <span class="caps">SXSW</span> and working on redesigning my site.  The fruit of that effort is what you see now.  I had been the Web Manager at <span class="caps">HSU</span> for about a year, and was just starting to get things happening.  I had recently hired <a href="http://charlesklein.org/">Charles</a>, which was the best decision ever.  </p>

<h2>Five Years Ago</h2>

<p>This one is amazing to me.  Five years ago we were living in Seattle, Washington while Brian did a post-doctoral fellowship.  I was working part-time as the webmaster for the <a href="http://www.burkemuseum.org">Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture</a>, and spending my free time knitting and reading as much as humanly possible about <span class="caps">CSS</span>.  We were living on a shoe-string, not sure where we would end up and how hard it would be for Brian and I to get real jobs.  We ended up lucking out on that one.</p>

<h2>Ten Years Ago</h2>

<p>In April 1996, I was in grad school in North Carolina.  Brian and I had just met in January, so we were enjoying the first few months of a new relationship.  In June we went on a collection trip for Brian&#8217;s research in which we drove all the way across the country&#8212; the famous &#8220;God Damn It, Andrea&#8221; trip during which we almost broke up, Brian almost stepped on a rattlesnake, and I made up a bunch of directions instead of reading the map for some reason.  I have yet to live that one down.  I left shortly after that to do my research in the Gal√°pagos.</p>

<p>Lots has changed since those days&#8230;</p>

<p>Now I get to tag three more folks.  I&#8217;ll choose <a href="http://wildlyappropriate.com">Dan</a>, <a href="http://glendathegood.com">Glenda</a>, and <a href="http://epersonae.com">Elaine</a>. :)</p>
