<p>With a little help from Warren Zevon, I was able to finally express what I have been feeling about events that have been happening this past week.</p>

<p>First there were the bombings in London, then <a href="http://joshuaink.com/">John Oxton taking his site offline</a>, and then the <a href="http://designinflight.com">death of Design in Flight</a>, which I was finally going to get around to subscribing to.  I know these things aren&#8217;t of the same magnitude, but they all add to a certain sense of melancholy and change that seems to be in the air right now.</p>

<p>I was heading home after an unusually shitty day at work yesterday (some fucker actually asked my if my parents had driven me up to college&#8212; they sure did, 15 <span class="caps">YEARS</span> <span class="caps">AGO</span>), when &#8220;Werewolves of London&#8221; came on the radio.  </p>

<p>After that first howl, the weight seemed to be a little lighter.  Before I knew it I was stopped at the gas station waiting to fill up until the song was over, howling &#8220;<span class="caps">AHHHOOOOO</span>, werewolves of London&#8221; at the top of my lungs, and feeling <em>much</em> better.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no stranger to howling&#8212; my dog is half husky and we howl with her from time to time to get a good laugh.  She can&#8217;t help but respond, and we can&#8217;t help but laugh at her dancing around, licking our faces, and making funny noises.  </p>

<p>Despite the sad sound of a howl, to a dog it&#8217;s a sound of solidarity, a kind of &#8220;I&#8217;m here and I&#8217;m one of you&#8221;.  Wolf packs will howl to strengthen their bonds, and neighboring packs will pick it up an howl with them.  That&#8217;s how I felt yesterday, like I was howling with John Oxton and the city of London, letting them know there&#8217;s another pack close by that can relate.</p>

<p>Somehow it helped.<br />
