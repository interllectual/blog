<p>I&#8217;m flying out for Alaska tomorrow morning, and it can&#8217;t come fast enough.  It&#8217;s really, really disturbing to me how hard it has become to rip myself away from this computer.  </p>

<p>Part of it is <a href="http://interllectual.com/article/257/rant-are-css-style-galleries-and-awards-sites-good-old-boys-clubs">this</a> <a href="http://joshuaink.com/blog/331/its-all-about-that-man-whitey">weekend&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://interllectual.com/article/265/article-264-in-which-andrea-eats-some-humble-pie-and-then-goes-to-alaska">hullabaloo</a> and my obsessive need to make sure nobody over at <a href="http://joshuaink.com/">John&#8217;s site</a> has tried to rip me a new one. But that&#8217;s only part of it.</p>

<p>Even when there&#8217;s nothing new to read, I can&#8217;t log off.  And I can&#8217;t focus enough to get any real work done.  I can&#8217;t account for where the time is going&#8212; I&#8217;m not playing games or surfing ebay (not even to <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/hicks_related_charity_auction.html">bid on the socks</a>).  I&#8217;m just being sucked into some weird NetNewsWire vortex.  And no offense, but no one really says anything so important that I need jump on it the instant it pops up.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m shutting down this computer now, and I going to not turn it on before my flight tomorrow, even if it kills me.  I&#8217;ll be back June 22.  If you want something to read in the meantime, <a href="http://interllectual.com/article/263/a-nod-from-the-wasp">please read this and add your comments</a>.  That article kind of got glossed over this weekend, and it&#8217;s really more important than all that other stuff that happened.</p>

<p>Later!</p>
