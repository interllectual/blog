<p><a href="http://www.humboldt.edu">Humboldt State University&#8217;s</a> new site went live last night at 8:45 pm.</p><h2><strong>&#8230;and the fit hits the shan</strong></h2><p>I got my first comment at 9:10 pm, entitled &#8220;Horrible Website!!!!! &#8220;, which stated that &#8220;it looks like a ghetto junior college&#8221;.</p><p>I have since received 5 more messages, all of them complaints from people within the institution, all with high-handed holier-than-thou language.  One of them discusses a &#8220;serious navigation flaw&#8221;, and goes on to explain how I should add particular navigation path, which would be helpful if it didn&#8217;t already exist.  It also suggests I look at current &#8220;web development standards&#8221;&#8230; wonder if these are the same ones I spend researching, utilizing, and teaching about every day at work? </p><p>It always amazes me how people within an institute of higher learning fight change tooth and nail.  This is the design some people actually want to keep.</p><p><img src="http://www.interllectual.com/images/oldsite.jpg" title="screenshot of old design" alt="screenshot of old design" /></p>
