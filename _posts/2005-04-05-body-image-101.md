<p>So, this weekend I was standing next to my size 4 sister (who was at the time bedecked in a gorgeous Vera Wang wedding dress that looked like it was made especially for her) wearing a lavender poof that they couldn&#8217;t even zip closed when I realized:</p>

<ol>
<li>time to take my doctor&#8217;s advice (..&#8220;you know, if you were in better shape, it might help stabilize the meds&#8230;&#8221;) and start working out</li>
<li>time to switch from beer to wine, and maybe (the horror!) cut back on it all</li>
<li>this process is really designed to make brides feel great and bridesmaids feel shitty&#8212; why else would they even <em>make</em> lavender dresses?</li>
<li>I must <em>really</em> love my sister to be putting up with feeling like this about myself, and to be actually considering cutting back on the cocktails for god&#8217;s sake; and</li>
<li>I have been officially brainwashed by mass-media</li>
</ol>
