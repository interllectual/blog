<p>Wow.  I just googled myself (god I love that verb) to find a link for another article, and a found <a href="http://pericat.ca/unlock/archives/2004/03/09/surfing-while-drinking-beer/">this post</a> on a blog called <a href="http://pericat.ca/unlock/">unlocking the air</a> from last year.  She calls <a href="http://doingfine.org">doing fine</a> &#8220;so beautiful it hurts&#8221; and quotes a passage.</p>

<p>I am speechless about this, my first public compliment, and I wish I found it back when it was written.  I am honored.</p>

<p>And also insecure.  Is this new design so beautiful it hurts?  The theme too personal to resonate with others?  Was the beauty really me in the first place?</p>

<p>Anyhow, thanks for the props.</p>
