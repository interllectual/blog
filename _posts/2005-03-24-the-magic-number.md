<p>3: the number of egrets I saw on my drive in to work today</p>

<p>3: the number of hawks I saw on the drive home yesterday</p>

<p>3: after this weekend, the number of time I will have redesigned this site this month</p>

<p>1003: reasons I&#8217;m glad we live in Humboldt County.  The latest: in the middle of his appointment, Brian&#8217;s <a href="http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/">cancer doctor</a> walked home to get his photo albums from a recent trip to Antarctica, and proceeded to go through the photos and chat with him for an hour about the trip.  Then he sent the albums home with Brian so I could see them.  And then he told Brian, &#8220;Oh by the way, you&#8217;re fine&#8221;.</p>

<p>33: how many I am today.</p>
