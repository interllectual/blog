<p>Well, <a href="http://interllectual.com/margarita/that-post-conference-buzz">that buzz</a> is gone.  The evaluations came in today, and killed what was left of it.  Reality had pretty much already done the job by then, though.</p>

<p>I am at a point where I am reevaluating a lot of things in my life, and this blog is one of them.  I have found myself censoring my posts more and more, especially after publicly speaking on university web issues.  The goal of this site was always to be a personal expression for all aspects of myself, even the parts that aren&#8217;t so pretty and aren&#8217;t geared toward finding myself future work and opportunities.  However, as soon as I started getting work and opportunities from it, the personal expression started getting stifled. Now it all feels false.  Cameron Moll even <a href="http://alistapart.com/articles/redesignrealign">killed my tagline</a> (&#8220;Where redesign is the the new black&#8221;)&#8212; now it has a built in reminder that I am good but not great.  Actually, maybe that&#8217;s the part that isn&#8217;t false.</p>

<p>I have considered <a href="http://joshuaink.com/blog/379/the-end">pulling an Oxton</a>, or moving the personal stuff to <a href="http://interllectual.com/margarita/my-new-domain">another site</a>.  That is a false dichotomy, though, and I will end up with two sites that I neglect instead of just one.  So I don&#8217;t know what will happen.</p>

<p>Luckily, my little sister has the good sense to be getting married a week from today, and to be doing so on the Big Island of Hawaii.  This gives me a legitimate excuse to go spend a week in a 5-star hotel in a tropical paradise and drown my sorrows in coconut and rum-filled drinks.  There will also be a fancy dress involved at one point, and as always, some kick-ass shoes.  Life could be worse.</p>

<p>I will not be blogging from Hawaii, but I won&#8217;t be leaving my brand new powerbook home all by itself, either.  If you&#8217;re interested, you&#8217;ll probably be able to keep up with my shenanigans on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/interllectual/">Flickr</a>.</p>
