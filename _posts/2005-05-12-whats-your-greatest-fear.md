<p>First, a note: I have recently created three <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds so that those of you interested my professional articles but not my personal musings can <a href="/?atom=1&#38;#38;section=article" title="Articles only feed">subscribe just to the articles</a>, and <a href="/?rss=1&#38;#38;section=musings" title="Musings only feed">vice versa</a>.  <a href="/?rss=1" title="Combined feed">The feed that combines all the content</a> is still in place for those of you who want to get the whole picture.  You don&#8217;t need to change anything to stay subscribed to the combined feed. <a href="/feeds">More details are available here</a>. </p>

<p>Now onto the good stuff.</p>

<h2>( <em>Blush</em> )</h2>

<p>After having some great fun embarrassing <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk" title="check out his kick-ass new design, then check it out again in IE">a new friend</a> in the last couple of days, <a href="http://www.glendathegood.com/blog/?p=29" title="I did NOT write this post to propagate that photo ;] ">complete with unflattering photos and references to bodily functions</a> (the old stand-bys never let you down), I got to thinking about what would embarrass me the most.</p>

<p>I have always been terribly afraid of being embarrassed.  I don&#8217;t know if this has to do with my gender or my chemistry or just my personality, but the thought of making a fool of myself fills me with terror.  After having already dealt with <a href="http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org" title="Brian won a battle with lymphoma two years ago">the big C</a> and the <a href="http://www.freedomfromfear.com/commread.asp?id=73" title="I battle depression daily">the big D</a>, I have to say that feeling embarrassed is what I fear the most. </p>

<p>My quest to not embarrass myself has led to claims of shyness, avoidance of public speaking, and various other insecurities and defense mechanisms.  I am getting better at dealing with it&#8212; I have learned that I often know what I&#8217;m talking about and therefore am unlikely to embarrass myself, and when I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about I can fake it with the best of them.  (I&#8217;m convinced that this is a skill that boys learn early on, but most girls have to practice at it).</p>

<p>But there is still one thing I cannot fake, and that is an ability to sing.</p>

<h2>( <em>Tremble</em> )</h2>

<p>Like the Schwandts and Hetslers that came before me, when the singing voices were handed &#8216;round, I must have been otherwise occupied.  Listening to my family sing &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; has caused permanent damage to sensitive ears the world over.   We can appreciate the finer points of music and we can play instruments, but we cannot carry a tune to save our lives.</p>

<p>This would all be fine if I didn&#8217;t have a secret desire to be able to belt out cheesy 80&#8217;s tunes (&#8220;Careless Whisper&#8221;, &#8220;Kiss Me Deadly&#8221;) at karaoke with my friends that were blessed with prefect pitch (I&#8217;m looking at you, Jess).  </p>

<p>Now, some of you may know that I&#8217;m no stranger to the beer or to the martini, if conditions are right.  I usually don&#8217;t let things get out of hand, but there have been times when my inhibitions have seemed to be a bit lowered. And I can&#8217;t be completely sure that won&#8217;t ever happen again.</p>

<p>So my greatest fear is that I will have those lowered inhibitions, a microphone will be at hand, and Anthony will be there will a <span class="caps">DVD</span> recorder.  I think I would quite simply have to crawl into a hole and never come out again.</p>

<h2>Your Turn</h2>

<p>What&#8217;s your greatest fear?  I promise, rational or irrational, I won&#8217;t use it against you on the interweb.</p>
