<p>I&#8217;ve finally gotten time to get this project of mine off the ground.  After about a year of helping my husband get through <a href="http://leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_page?item_id=8312">cancer</a>, I have decided that I need to do this for myself.  Getting him to the point where he&#8217;s OK has made me realize the ways in which I am not.  And the ways in which I am.</p>

<p>I have had depression for at least 15 years, and it&#8217;s something I deal with every day. However, only two people in my life know about it outside of my immediate family. I have come to realize that hiding something that&#8217;s such a major part of myself has taken its toll on my sanity.  I am now coming clean about it here, where it somehow seems a little easier to do.</p>

<p>For me, it&#8217;s a medical problem that I, along with most of the women in my family, inherited.  My grandmother committed suicide in 1969 because of it, 3 years before my birth.  It&#8217;s something that literally has been affecting me since before I was born.</p>

<p>There is a huge stigma attached to it, mostly because it&#8217;s poorly understood.  Also because it mainly affects women.  It&#8217;s easy to laugh at and/or doubt those who have to take medicine for problems we can&#8217;t really detect.  Those who need chemotherapy or insulin aren&#8217;t assumed to be faking it, but those who take antidepressants are thought to be using it as a crutch, or a &#8220;mood enhancer&#8221;.  Not so.  But I&#8217;m not going to go off on a tanget about this.  Suffice it to say that it&#8217;s a genetic, physical problem that can be overcome by helping my body out with some processes it can&#8217;t do very well by itself. </p>

<p>I am finally to the point where I&#8217;m at peace with the decisions I&#8217;ve made regarding my health, and I&#8217;m ready to own them and make them publicly part of me.  </p>

<p>After deciding this, I realized that I had a lot that I want to do in my life, and one is to contribute to a community that has unknowingly helped me through some hard times lately&#8212; the <span class="caps">CSS</span> and web standards community.  I have taken to doing a lot of reading about and experimenting with <span class="caps">CSS</span> while Brian has been sick, and I have teaching web standards to the student assistants I co-manage at work. I think I have some points to add to the dialog from a different angle: education, both of the educators in our institutions and of our future web designers.</p>

<p>So, this blog is not about depression, it&#8217;s about being a creative, productive member of society that happens to have depression.</p>
