<p>Well, I am off for the holidays.  I am going to spend them in Seattle with my newlywed sister and her hubby, along with my parents.</p>

<p>I think this is the first time in my life that I have looked forward to a 12-hour car ride as a much needed break.  I would take car sickness over this craziness any day.  My mind is swirling with ideas and I don&#8217;t have enough hours in the day to do them.  A forced break from it all is what I need to put things in perspective.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also looking forward to being in the big city for a few days, and meeting up with some old friends we haven&#8217;t seen since we lived there about 5 years ago.  We&#8217;re also taking the dog with us, which should be fun.  She&#8217;s getting old and doesn&#8217;t have many road trips left in her.  She told me she&#8217;s so excited she can&#8217;t stand it.  Well, that excitement may be over the new squeaky squirrel toy she got for the trip, but that works too.</p>

<p>So have a happy holiday, or un-holiday if you prefer, and I will be back with a vengeance next year.  Good wishes to you and yours, whatever species they may be.<br />
