<p>Wow, I haven&#8217;t written anything in a while&#8230;</p>

<p>I have been just plain busy&#8212; with client work, the holidays that just passed and the ones that are coming, my sister&#8217;s wedding, and a random inspiration to do major renovations in our house. That last point is what I want to highlight here, since it is a little too exciting for me&#8230;</p>

<h2>I guess you could call me bookish</h2>

<p>I love books.  I read every night before I go to sleep, and sometimes on the weekends I&#8217;ll stay in bed reading for a couple of hours before I get up.  I have been doing this since I was about 3 years old.  I also have slight pack-rat tendencies, and a husband that is also a reader, leading to quite an accumulation of books.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t consider this a problem, because I love to go back to them and leaf through them and re-read them and think about them.  The only real problem is that they end up taking up a lot of space.  </p>

<p>We ended up hitting critical mass with books last weekend, with all our shelves full and random piles of books lying everywhere, as documented in <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/interllectual/sets/1461376/">this Flickr set</a>.  The logical thing would be to get rid of some of them, but I could never bring myself to do that.  Even the crappy pulp novels are worth something to me&#8212; have some intangible essence that makes getting rid of them seem like it would be evil.</p>

<p>So instead, we spent a couple days ripping out a built-in buffet in our house and converting it to a built in bookcase.  Those that know our cooking habits can attest that this is a much better use of valuable redwood and Douglas fir for us.  The buffet was full of old papers and receipts&#8230;</p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/interllectual/68190659/in/set-1461376/">The new bookcase kicks ass</a>, and holds about 300 books.  The whole middle shelf is the &#8220;sciency&#8221; section, and the top is &#8220;photos&#8221; and &#8220;classics&#8221;.  Bottom left is &#8220;knitting&#8221; and the rest is just random.  &#8220;Computery&#8221; books, textbooks, field guides, reference books, and books in Spanish are in the office.  (I double-majored in Biology and Spanish Literature in college, so I have a good collection of Spanish books.)</p>

<p>The best part of the whole experience was having an excuse to look at all our books while we were organizing them.  I found some awesome things that I had forgotten about, like my original comic book of &#8220;Donald Duck in Mathmagic Land&#8221;.  I am going to put some photos up of this on Flickr sometime soon.  It was also nice that after the <span class="caps">NPR</span> story about Wallace Stevens on Tuesday, I could go right to my copy of &#8220;The Poem at the End of the Mind&#8221; and page through it, without having to search all over the house.</p>

<p>Anyway, now the books are organized and I found some inspiration.  I also figured out what I&#8217;m going to do with <a href="http://interllectual.com/margarita/my-new-domain">Jangly Ganglia</a>, so expect that sometime in the not-too-distant future.</p>
