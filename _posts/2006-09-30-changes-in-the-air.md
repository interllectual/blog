<p>So, I have been trying out <a href="http://vox.com">Vox</a> for a couple of weeks, and I have to say that I&#8217;m impressed.  The interface is really nice, and makes it a snap to add photos, video, audio, and books to your posts.  It also allows you to control who can see an individual post&#8212; you can restrict access to friends, family, or friends &#38; family.  This is the most important aspect for me&#8212; I have been finding that there are things I want to write about that are not really relevant to anyone but my family, and that I don&#8217;t want to have out there flying around and getting indexed by Google.</p>

<p>The easy listing and rating of books is also great for me&#8212; I read every night and have been wanting a way to easily catalog and discuss what I&#8217;m reading.  The templates are fun, and use <span class="caps">CSS</span> for layout with somewhat semantic classes and ids.  It is kind of a relief to be able to just write and not focus on design or functionality of the site, as well&#8212; I do enough of that during the day job, and I&#8217;m finding it really nice to just focus on writing.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about my career a lot lately&#8212; where it&#8217;s going, where I want it to go, and how to get there.  One of the steps I may be taking is moving the personal posts off of this blog and making it a more professional site, able to morph into a site for my business if things go that way.  So for a while at least all the personal stuff will be found on my Vox site, <a href="http://andreaarbogast.vox.com/">Graceful Degradation</a>, while I test out this idea.  One great thing is that I am also able to cross-post my <a href="http://janglyganglia.com">Jangly Ganglia</a> posts from there, so I only have to blog in two places, and my three readers can have one-stop shopping on Vox if they want.</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://andreaarbogast.vox.com/">check me out on Vox</a>.  And, let me know if you want a Vox invitation&#8212; I have a few.</p>
