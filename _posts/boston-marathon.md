Have spent the last 1/2 hour looking at coverage of this insanity. Going to go home, have a drink, love my family, and then tune back in to the news after the initial shock coverage is over. This after reading [an article today in the Guardian](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli) about how following the news is bad for you.
