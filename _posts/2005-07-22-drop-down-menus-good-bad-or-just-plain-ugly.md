<p>One of my favorite quotes about web design is this, from <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0604f.shtml">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I see a drop-down menu, I know that a committee sat around a table, unwilling to think through the organization of the siteâ€™s material into a user-focused structure â€?? or unwilling to accept the recommendation of an information architect who spent days making sense of the siteâ€™s offerings. A drop-down menu tells me there were too many decision makers, none of whom understood that the userâ€™s needs were more important than their ego-driven desire to win front-page placement for their little piece of the content puzzle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quote always make me want to stand up and shout &#8220;Hallelujah!&#8221;.  I hate drop-down, fly-out and other crazy menu schemes.  I find them awkward, distracting, and and a sure sign of a design compromise.</p>

<p>However, lately I&#8217;ve been finding myself reconsidering my vow never to use them on our university web site.  I am starting to think they are <em>perfect</em> for universities, precisely because of what Zeldman points out. </p>

<p>I get requests every week from some university constituent asking to have their link added to the home page. This puts me in the situation of constantly having to defend the navigation structure of the site, which actually does have a lot of thought behind it.  It also puts me in the position of having to deny deans and vice presidents home page links to their pet projects.  </p>

<p>Since I have the political power of an assistant dean&#8217;s pet goldfish, this is not a fun situation for me to be in.  Sometimes folks take a denial well, and sometimes they go to the president and try to have him order me to make a change.  This is not good for the ulcer.</p>

<p>What is the solution? A committee!  I run these requests by a committee, and the committee makes the decision.  This prevents me from having to take the full brunt of the retribution that comes down the line, and allows me to sometimes get a good night&#8217;s sleep.  Do you see what I&#8217;m getting at?  The navigation of university web site is almost <em>necessarily</em> determined by committee.  This may make drop-down, fly-out navigation the <strong>ideal</strong> navigation scheme for a university site.</p>

<p>Things would be <em>so much easier</em> if I could just stick these requested links in some fly-out menu where no one but the requester will ever see it.  It would make everyone happy, except maybe the users, but I&#8217;m not convinced that the users wouldn&#8217;t be happy as well.</p>

<p>I also frequently get design advice from the campus community, and it is often suggested that I implement drop-down menus.  When I work on department sites, it&#8217;s often the first thing the clients ask for.  People seem to love them around here.  Just last week I was pointed to <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu/"><span class="caps">CSU</span> Chico&#8217;s site</a> by someone who thinks I need some schooling about how to organize the homepage. </p>

<p>And it seems that some <a href="http://shauninman.com">well-known designers</a> have come around to this conclusion as well.  Silverpoint, a web design company that Shaun Inman is a part of, just launched a new site for <a href="http://www.choate.edu/home/">Choate Rosemary Hall</a>.  The site is a drop-down, fly-out extravaganza.  It is well-done and has made it onto some of those <a href="http://www.stylegala.com/archive/choate.htm">design award sites</a>.</p>

<p>So I am asking myself, is it worth it to have these drop-down drag-out fly-out fights over the site&#8217;s navigation, or should I adopt the committee mentality and embrace what may be the perfect solution?  What do you think?</p>
