<p>Well, I am enjoying my new toys. </p>

<p>Panther is elegant, and I&#8217;m finally satisfied with my mail client. Mail 1.3&#8217;s threading is even better than what I&#8217;ve seen in other apps.</p>

<p>Expos√© is going to make my life a lot easier, especially when developing web sites. I tend to have about 50 windows open at once while I&#8217;m working on a site, and now it will be much easier to switch between them.  Together with font book (finally a way to manage fonts without paying out the nose for it!), designing sites should be a lot more efficient.</p>

<p>The new version of Safari, 1.1, is the biggest surprise for me so far. They seem to have worked a lot of the rendering bugs out, and it is now supporting pretty much any <span class="caps">CSS</span> I can throw at it.  Hopefully they will <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/buzz/archive/2003_10.html#a000231" title="Ian Lloyd spaks about this on the WaSP">make it available to everyone</a>, so you don&#8217;t need to buy a new operating system to get it.  That sounds like the other OS manufacturer we all hate&#8230;</p>

<p>Natalie had a really fun baby shower, and talk about new toys&#8230; Both the mom and the baby will be having lots of fun with the new loot.  Can&#8217;t wait to meet the little tyke!<br />
