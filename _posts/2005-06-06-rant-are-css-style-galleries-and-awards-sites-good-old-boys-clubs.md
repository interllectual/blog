<p>This post was spurred by the news that <a href="http://joshuaink.com/blog/320/">John Oxton has been added as a weekly judge</a> for the <a href="http://www.webstandardsawards.com">Web Standards Awards</a>.  Congrats John!  You deserve it, and this not personal.</p>

<p>I clicked over to the <span class="caps">WSA</span> to check out who the other judges were.  They&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.webstandardsawards.com/criteria/">an impressive international list of folks</a>.  One out of 11 is female.  <a href="http://www.makikoitoh.com/">Thanks for representing us, Maki</a>.</p>

<p>I then went over to <a href="http://www.stylegala.com">StyleGala</a> to have a look at what designs are hot these days.  I noticed, along the way, that <a href="http://www.stylegala.com/news/">ten out of ten news contributers are male</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.stylegala.com/archive/">five out of six site reviewers</a>.  <a href="http://xox.lealea.net/">Cheers, Lea, thanks for doing all the work for us girls</a>!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cssbeauty.com"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Beauty</a> is run by a man, as is the <a href="http://cssvault.com/"><span class="caps">CSS</span> Vault</a>.  I guess it should really be no surprise to me that <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/look_out_johnny_foreigner.html#comment18">the web is seemingly so male oriented</a>, as <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk">Malarkey</a> puts it.  At least the <span class="caps">CSS</span>/Web Standards community. I mean, whether a site award-worthy or gallery-worthy in this community is being determined almost exclusively by men.</p>

<p>This is not sour grapes, as I have never submitted any of my work to these sites and don&#8217;t presume to think that it belongs there.  What I do not believe, however, is that there are not more that two women who deserve to be in the group of 29 people who are judging standards-based design.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk">Malarkey, I&#8217;m linking to you again because</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m determined to get you to answer at least one in ten of my communications to you, you <del>lazy</del> busy&#8230; ; )</li>
<li>As a contributer to both the <span class="caps">WSA</span> and StyleGala who I&#8217;m reasonably sure appreciates the design talents of women, maybe you can enlighten me as to how this came about.</li>
</ol>

<p>Does this bother anyone else?</p>
