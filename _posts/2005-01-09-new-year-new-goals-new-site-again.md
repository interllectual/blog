<p>OK. My New Year&#8217;s resolution is to turn this blog into something I&#8217;m proud of.</p><p>I&#8217;ve come to terms with the fact that writing is kind of painful for me, but that it&#8217;s also necessary. Kind of like exercise or public speaking or waxing.</p><p>So, expect the site to be stripped of its design yet again.  I&#8217;m going to come up with something good this time, I can feel it&#8230;</p>
