I had a few days to myself, and what do you know, I ended up redoing my personal site. Seems to be kind of a pattern for me. 

I am really liking this new setup. I liked the flat-file site I had going with [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am), but development of that product seems to have stopped. I had a look at [Skrivr](http://skrivr.com), but it didn't really resonate enough to get me to make a switch. Then I read the [24Ways article on Jekyll and GitHub pages](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/), and for the first time Jekyll clicked with me.

It took me about a day to figure out how to get everything up and running, including hacking together a couple of OS X services that automatically format link posts and quote posts for me from selected text in the browser. It took about another day to choose and modify a theme to do what I wanted, and about half a day to reformat and clean up the yaml data in my Scriptogram posts. So not bad.

As alsways, it remains to be seen whether I will actually keep this version alive and kicking, but I am happy so far with the process.
