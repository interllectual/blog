<p>Gerry McGovern hits on a pet-peeve of mine and gives a great example of how internal needs may not work for your customers in <a href="http://newsweaver.ie/gerrymcgovern/e_article000587639.cfm">Choose Customer Words, Not Organization Words</a>.  I love how he blasts the idea of publishing press releases on the home page, and scorns the &#8220;self-congratulatory waffle&#8221;. I&#8217;d also add &#8220;Welcome to the ___ Department Web Site&#8221; to the list of phrases that need to die&#8230;</p>
