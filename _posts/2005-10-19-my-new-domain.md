<p>I am once again master of my domain, having picked up a new one this weekend.  I thought I&#8217;d let the cat out of the bag before <a href="http://walscapades.com/?page_id=3">Steve</a> explodes.</p>

<p>The inspiration came from Neal Stephenson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/main.html">Cryptonomicon</a>, which I am about 3/4 of the way through reading, so no spoilers please.  The following passage made me go into convulsive giggle fits on the plane.  You&#8217;ve got to love anyone who can combine biological nerdery with a description of the protagonist lying on the floor after being punched in the face for trying to hit on a girl in a imperfectly understood foreign language.  All within the context of information technology nerdery, and with the kind of jaunty tone that I can never get enough of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some sort of commotion is happening up in that remote plane of most people&#8217;s heads, five to six feet above the floor, where social interaction traditionally takes place.  Mary&#8217;s date is being hustled off to the side by a large powerful fellow&#8212; it is hard to recognize faces at this angle, but a good candidate would be Rod. Rod is shouting in <a href="http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Qwghlm">Qwghlmian</a>.  Actually, everyone is shouting in Qwghlmian&#8212; even the ones who are speaking English&#8212; because Waterhouse&#8217;s speech-recognition centers have a bad case of jangly ganglia.  Best to leave that fancy stuff for later, and concentrate on more basic phylogenesis: it would be nice, for example, to be a vertebrate again.  After that, quadrupedal locomotion might come in handy.<br />
A perky Qwghlmian-Australian fellow in an <span class="caps">RAAF</span> uniform steps up and grabs his right anterior fin, jerking him up the evolutionary ladder before he&#8217;s ready [&#8230;]</p>

<p>I am now the proud owner of janglyganglia.com.  I still can&#8217;t even say that out loud without smiling.</p>

<p>What I am going to do at Jangly Ganglia?  I have no idea.  But I couldn&#8217;t resist the delicious ridiculousness of one day introducing myself as &#8220;Andrea of Jangly Ganglia dot com.&#8221;  And with domain names being about nine bucks through <a href="http://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>, it was a bargain indeed.</p>

<p>So what do you think I should do there?  I&#8217;m up for ideas.  I kind of like the idea of doing something collaborative. I also like the idea of exploring those crazy situations in life that leave your head reeling, and your ganglia jangling.  Thoughts?</p>
