# Agility weekend, finally

## Taught on Saturday
* felt good to be outside and not too hot
* felt good to be excited about Agility again
* felt good to have my students learning and growing and succeeding
* Beth gave me 5 lbs of shrimp that a client gave her (she is deathly allergic) and I went to the store and got groceries and cooked dinner from a recipe.

## rained on Sunday
Was going to give a private but it got rained out. Took Twister with me in the afternoon to tear down the course. H had so much fun playing on the course, and did teeters (full) and ran the weave channels for the first time. I think he is a natural.
