<p>Seriously. This should be obvious. Why would you make inaccessible videos about accessibility?</p>

<p>Yet, I have found this happening more and more lately. I has become very frustrating for me, because some of the videos are great, and I would love to use them in the accessibility training materials I am assembling. However, for reasons that should be obvious, I cannot use inaccessible training materials in a course about accessibility.</p>

<p>Some recent examples that come to mind are: <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?ei=UTF-8&#38;b=16&#38;vid=514676&#38;gid=133414">Victor Tsaran: &ldquo;An Introduction to Screen Readers&rdquo;</a> on <span class="caps">YUI</span> Theater, the <a href="http://www.assistiveware.com/videos.php">AssistiveWare videos on computer accessibility</a>, and <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/12/using-alt-attributes-smartly.html">Using <span class="caps">ALT</span> attributes smartly</a> on the Official Google Webmaster Central Blog.</p>

<p>Come on guys. Practice what you preach.</p>
