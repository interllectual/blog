<p>In the past month, on my drive home from work, I have watched 3 small mammals get consumed by great egrets.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m fairly certain 2 were field mice (<em>Peromyscus spp.</em>) and one was a vole (<em>Microtus spp.</em>).</p>

<p>It amazes me that I can be zipping by at 55 mph and see this little drama play out.  It is intense: a cute fuzzy thing with flailing limbs, wriggling for its life in the bright yellow beak of an elegant, serene bird.  I never get to see how it ends, but I have a good idea.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had my hand in the beak of <a href="http://www.oceanfootage.com/stockfootage/Masked+Booby//?DVfSESSCKIE=d3a34fed262b4907eed6a68d8d07a69d74bae52b">a similar bird</a> a few times, and it always ended with several layers of skin neatly removed from said hand, and much profanity on my part.  I&#8217;ve got the scars to prove it.  I have a feeling the little guys aren&#8217;t getting away with just scars.</p>
