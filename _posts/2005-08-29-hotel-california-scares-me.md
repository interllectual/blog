summary: <p>The other day I received a link exchange request that said: &#8220;I have found your website humboldt.edu by searching Yahoo for &#8216;hotel california song meaning&#8217;. &#8220; Which has a special freakiness for me, because <em>I cannot escape from Hotel California</em>.  It&#8217;s like I can check out anytime I like, but I can never leave.</p>

<p>Being the webmaster of a University, and having to answer the webmaster@ email address, I get the joy of wading through metric tons of spam.  My filter does a pretty good job with most things, but one class of spam it doesn&#8217;t deal with very well is link exchange requests.  You know&#8212; the &#8220;I think our sites are similar and if you link to me I&#8217;ll link to you&#8221; garbage.  A word to the wise: No university webmaster is <em>ever</em> going to link to you because you send them an email and ask them to.  I won&#8217;t even link to half the folks <em>within</em> the university, in a vain attempt to keep the information architecture under control.</p>

<p>Anyway, these link exchange requests usually go straight into the trash, but the other day I received on that gave me pause.  It started out like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have found your website humboldt.edu by searching Yahoo for &#8220;hotel california song meaning&#8221;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which has a special freakiness for me, because <em>I cannot escape from Hotel California</em>.  It&#8217;s like I can check out anytime I like, but I can never leave.  I hear that song at least once a week, despite my best efforts not to.  This all started when I realized about a year ago that I hear Hotel California at least once on every roadtrip.  You know when you get out into the middle of nowhere, and you can&#8217;t get anything on the radio but a crappy classic rock station?  As soon as that happens I know I&#8217;m about to hear the Eagles.  And not just any Eagles song.</p>

<p>I decided that Hotel California was probably never <em>off</em> the radio; that at any point in time there is some station somewhere playing it.  As soon as I started telling my friends my little theory, I started hearing it more and more.</p>

<p>So, after receiving this particular piece of spam, I decided I <em>had</em> to make sure <span class="caps">HSU</span> wasn&#8217;t really coming up on Yahoo searches for &#8220;hotel california song meaning&#8221;.  I went through the first 100 results before I got bored, and saw no references to our school, thank goodness.  I did, however, find <em>way too many sites</em> that discuss the meaning of that song.  I&#8217;m not linking to any of them, because I need to free myself from this whole Hotel California thing.  </p>

<p>This is my catharsis.  Thanks for listening.</p>
