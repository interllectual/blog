<p>You know you&#8217;re in trouble when Vic Chesnutt perfectly sums up your mood.</p>

<p>My motivation is gone, and I have too much to do.</p>

<p>Today I had two cups of coffee, then went out to breakfast and had three more.  When we got back, the dog had eaten all the cat&#8217;s food again, and I couldn&#8217;t even yell at her, because I had big plans to take a nap cuddled up with both of them.  Which I proceeded to do for two hours.  Now I am drinking more coffee.</p>

<p>It has seemed like dusk all day, which isn&#8217;t helping.  I need to be working.  I have to give a talk in about a week, and have no idea what I&#8217;m going to say.  I am dealing with this fact by avoiding it entirely.  The amount of crap I have to wade through at work before I leave for the wedding is inexpressible.</p>

<p>I was supposed to be creative today, or at least get the talk together.  I just can&#8217;t make myself care.</p>
