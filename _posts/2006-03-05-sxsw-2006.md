<p>On Friday I am off to <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a>.  I am really looking forward to catching up with the folks I met last year, and meeting some new friends.  There&#8217;s nothing like a place full of hundreds of web geeks to give me a shot of inspiration.</p>

<p>I will be at Buffalo Billiards at 6:30 on Saturday for the University Web Developers meetup.  You are all invited&#8212; come say hi and meet your colleagues in meatspace!  Chip Diffendaffer from Denver U. deserves much credit for organizing this get-together.  We will then all be moving over to the opening party at 8.</p>

<p>I am still figuring out which panels and parties I will be attending, so I won&#8217;t bore you by posting them here.  Plus, I tend to decide these things on the spur of the moment, and will just end up changing my mind if I try to plan too far in advance. </p>

<p>Just make sure you say Hi if you see me.  Looking forward to finally meeting some of you all!</p>
