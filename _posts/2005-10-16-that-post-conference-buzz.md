<p>I don&#8217;t know how it happens, but whenever I go to a conference, I come back 5 years younger.  This lasts for a couple of weeks, before I go through an accelerated aging process and end up back where I started.  </p>

<p>But right now I have that post-cenference buzz (I don&#8217;t mean <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/interllectual/52287659/in/photostream/">this post-conference buzz</a>, but that one was good too&#8230;). I have so much energy that my head is spinning, so I needed to write this brain dump before I write a more serious post about the <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery/default.asp">E-recruitment conference</a>.  Man, <a href="http://2006.sxsw.com/interactive/?PHPSESSID=35f174abffca2dcf892afb9fb5340f8c"><span class="caps">SXSW</span></a> can&#8217;t come fast enough for me right now.</p>

<p>So here are some disjointed thoughts, in random order:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have offically determined that the optimum number of pairs of shoes to take to a conference is six.  This is the number I took to <span class="caps">SXSW</span> last year (remember, Chris?), as well as to this conference.  Both times, I ended up wearing shoes that I would have cut if I had decided to lighten the load.  Given the direct link between my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/interllectual/30156004/">kick-ass shoes</a> and my self-confidence, I guess this is no suprise.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/">LiquidMatrix</a> and <a href="http://www.datatel.com/">Datatel</a> folks are fun, generous, and talented.  <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery/bios/mierzwa.asp">Michelle</a>, <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery/bios/dempster.asp">Matt</a>, <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery/bios/tracey.asp">Graham</a>, and <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery/bios/marshall.asp">David</a> all need to go to <span class="caps">SXSW</span> because I didn&#8217;t have enough time to talk to them in San Diego.  Plus, we need a stronger educational component there&#8212; there&#8217;s is great stuff coming out of that arena.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.goclipless.com/">Graham</a> <em>may</em> have convinced me of the merits of blogrolls.  I may have to do some experimenting with one around here.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t hate speaking as much as I thought I might.  I was nervous, but it turned out OK.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery/bios/dempster.asp">Matt</a> did six presentations! Ranging from usability testing, to web standards to unobtrusive javascript. Truly impressive.</li>
<li>I got all the way to San Diego, started unpacking my bag (that I had checked on the plane, mind you) and realized that <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/interllectual/52225757/">I&#8217;m never going to be able to get rid my life of redwood leaves</a>. Maybe I should change my logo.</li>
<li>It was interesting, and I must say a bit refreshing, to think about universities from a business point of view for a few days.</li>
<li>I learned some corporate secrets, but I&#8217;ll never tell.  Mwah ha ha!</li>
<li>I read a passage in <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/main.html">Cryptonomicon</a> on the plane ride home that made me laugh my head off, and led to me buying a new domain name last night.  More on this to come, since it merits its own post.</li>
</ul>
