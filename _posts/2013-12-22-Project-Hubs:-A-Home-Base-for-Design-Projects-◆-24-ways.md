The idea of a project hub is a great one, and may be something I try out at work. Even better, is the fact that Brad has linked up his own working hub for a project he is designing in the open, along with all the meeting notes, wireframes, style tiles, etc. It is fascinating to get a look into his process, and viewing and example of an outside process may be very useful for folks at work.
