<p>There is a lively discussion over at <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2003/12/05/women.html">StopDesign</a> on the lack of female voices in the web standards community.  I can&#8217;t wait to dive in to all the new sites that are showing up there.</p><p>I have been thinking about this for a while, I think ever since it became pretty obvious through the <span class="caps">CSS</span> Zen Garden that men were in a large majority.  As to why this is the case, I really think that women are probably less vocal than men  on this topic in their blogs, etc, not that there aren&#8217;t many women designing with standards.</p><p>There are other issues in my life that are important for me to express through my blog, <a href="http://www.doingfine.org/blog/archives/000003.html">some of which <em>are</em> at least partially a result of being female</a>.  These are the things I want to say and be an activist about&#8212; web standards are just the tool I use to achieve it.</p><p>Not to say that I don&#8217;t have anything interesting to add to the web standards discussion, and maybe I should be more vocal.  Maybe this is just the push I need to start getting out there and contributing.  </p><p>If I get this new job I will have a lot to say about converting a University&#8217;s site to web standards, which would be an important part of my agenda as webmaster at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu"><span class="caps">HSU</span></a>.  That, and getting rid of that hideous design&#8230;</p>
