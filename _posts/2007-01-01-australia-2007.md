<p>I&#8217;m going to skip the recap of 2006, and get right into what&#8217;s coming up in 2007.</p>

<p>Brian and I are about to embark on a trip we have been planning for years&#8212; a great Australian adventure.  We will be there from January 17 to February 28; six weeks of traveling, visiting colleagues, and seeing as much wildlife as humanly possible.</p>

<p>We will be spending a couple of weeks in Melbourne while Brian does a research project on <a href="http://www.wildlife.org.au/wildlife-gliders.php?page=w-gliders-greater.html">greater gliders</a>, a week in Tasmania, a week in Queensland, some time in Canberra and Albury, and about a week in and around Sydney.  Any suggestions about places or activities not to be missed would be much appreciated.  Also, any tips on dealing with a US cell phone over there and not paying an arm and a leg would be great. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to this trip immensely.  It has been a long time since I have been out of the country, and a long time since I have done any fieldwork. I will probably be taking a break from blogging while I&#8217;m there, except for trip updates for my friends and family. Between that and keeping <a href="http://bitesizestandards.com">Bite Size Standards</a> running, I&#8217;m guessing that I won&#8217;t have time for much else. </p>

<p>When we get back, I have a week before I leave for <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, so I will be pretty swamped until the middle of March.  So, have a great first few months of 2007.</p>
