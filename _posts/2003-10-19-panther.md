<p>Well, I broke down yesterday and ordered <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/overview/" title="Mac OS 10.3">Panther</a>.  I will have a lighter wallet, but I&#8217;m a sucker for new software.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping that it will be athe answer to all my <a href="http://www.doingfine.org/blog/archives/000008.html">mail woes</a>.  Plus, the fast user switching sould finally convince Brian not to clutter up my desktop with all his junk (yeah, right).</p>

<p>Anyway, I will be watching my mailbox closely on the 24th.  And I&#8217;ll probably be up late installing and playing.</p>

<p>In other news, I haven&#8217;t posted much lately beacuse in the past 2 weeks I&#8217;ve been home sick for 4 days and in West Virginia for 4 days.  So I have a lot of reading and posing to catch up on.</p>

<p>On the up side, Billy is married, in what must be tha largest wedding I&#8217;ve ever been to, and Becca and Scott are parents to Simon.  The world has been busy.<br />
