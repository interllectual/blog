<p>Gerry McGovern <a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/nt/2005/nt_2005_01_10_predictions-2005.htm">writes an interesting article</a> on his 10 predictions for web content management in 2005.  I especially hope point number 1 pans out:</p><blockquote><p>1. The editor&#8212;the person who knows the difference between good and bad content&#8212;will get increasing authority for the website.</p></blockquote><p>More and more, I&#8217;m frustrated that &#8220;content manager&#8221; means a technological solution, rather than a person who knows their content.  As the university web site get more and more pressure to standardize it&#8217;s web content, institutions are turning to sophisticated and expensive <span class="caps">CMS</span> solutions.</p><p>I am tending to think that we would be better served to hire a content specialist&#8212; an editor&#8212; that can work with the departments to produce good content and the web office to get it posted.  As Jeff Veen puts it in <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000315.php">an inspired article</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Content management is not a technology problem. If you&#8217;re having trouble managing the content on your Web site, it&#8217;s because you have an editorial process problem.</p></blockquote><p>We need a new model.  Something tells me that adding another decentralized process to our already decentralized university web site is going to fail.</p>
