<p>During our weekly brainstorming session this morning, we hit that place that is all too familiar&#8212; the place where the project would be cross the cool barrier and the suits and faculty would complain that it&#8217;s &#8220;not academic enough&#8221;.  Charles and I decided that we just need to do a <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8913084255008000794">Ballmer-esque dance</a> showing the department how much we think of them, and we&#8217;d all live happily ever after. I have had the mantra of &#8220;Departments, Departments, Departments, Departments&#8221; in my head all day long&#8230;<br />
