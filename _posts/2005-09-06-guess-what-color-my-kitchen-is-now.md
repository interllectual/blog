<p>Brian and I spent all weekend painting the kitchen.  The first person that guesses the color gets to determine the next <a href="/animal">animal theme</a> I add to this site.  Hopefully you can remember what used to be here before the redesign&#8212; if not, I&#8217;ll give you a list.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll give you a hint.  Wait, no I won&#8217;t.  I&#8217;ll tell you what color my kitchen used to be: terracotta with red/orange accents.</p>

<p>Here is a crappy photo of what it looked like:</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
