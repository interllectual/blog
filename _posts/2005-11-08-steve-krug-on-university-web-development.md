<p>This excerpt from <a href="http://www.sensible.com/">Steve Krug&#8217;s</a> keynote presentation at HighEdWebDev 2005 just made my morning (via <a href="http://collegewebeditor.com/blog/index.php/archives/2005/11/08/live-from-highedwebdev-2005-in-rochester-steve-krugs-good-tips-on-website-usability-in-colleges-and-universities/">Collegewebeditor.com</a>):</p>

<h2>Top 9 reasons why it s*cks to be you</h2>

<ol>
<li>Corporate expectations in a non-profit budget</li>
<li>Stakeholders who can be petty and whiney in ways that wouldn&#8217;t dare in the real world</li>
<li>Find and implement a <span class="caps">CMS</span> in your spare time, and herd kittens into using it</li>
<li>Sub-site/fiefdom hell: We want our dept/school/project to have its own character</li>
<li>Multiple audiences</li>
<li>Homepage death match</li>
<li>Deans less likely to force everyone to the site-consistency line than <span class="caps">CEO</span>s</li>
<li>Tons of dynamic content of variable quality and enormous importance &#8212; to its creators</li>
<li>Cool-factor arms race to stay competitive</li>
</ol>

<p>Seems like number 3 is my task for today&#8230;</p>
