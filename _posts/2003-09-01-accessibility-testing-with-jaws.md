<p>Working for a <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu" title="Humboldt State University">governmental institution in the State of California</a> (please don&#8217;t ask me about our future governor&#8230;), web accessibility has been on my mind of late.  </p>
<p>I am a member of our campus&#8217; <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~wag">Web Accessibility Group</a>, and we a charged with coming up with a plan to make our extensive, and frankly, poorly designed campus website accessible.  This is a daunting task, to say the least.</p><p>I bring this up because I am in the somewhat privelidged position of being a web designer with access to <span class="caps">JAWS</span>. I have the ability to test my sites in a lab on campus set up for use by students with disabilities. I also have the 40 minute demo set up on several machines in our shop, where we have 3 staff an 15 student assistants (all sighted) making websites and courseware for faculty.</p><p>I must agree with Kynn Bartlett&#8217;s article <a title="Maccessibility: A Web Designer's Guide to JAWS" href="http://www.maccessibility.com/archive/000843.php">Maccessibility: A Web Designer&#8217;s Guide to <span class="caps">JAWS</span></a>, in that learning to use <span class="caps">JAWS</span> would take me at least a week, with my monitor turned off.  Listening to a website is a very eye-opening experience, and the first thing I realize is that I have no idea how to follow a link, go back, skip to content, etc.  if I wanted to.</p><p>That said, I find the 40 minute demo extremely useful if I just point it to a page and read through it, making sure all the content makes sense, that alt tags provide enough information, etc.  And I also find that if I code to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/" title="Web Accessibility Content Guidelines"><span class="caps">WCAG</span></a> specs that my pages usually make sense in <span class="caps">JAWS</span>, as <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/">David Shea suggests</a>.</p><p>The next step is to get a focus group together of students &#38; faculty who use <span class="caps">JAWS</span> or other screen readers.  Asking them to help us test the sites is really the only way to find out if they&#8217;re truly accessible.  This is a goal for our <span class="caps">WAG</span> group this year.</p>
