<p>OK, it was worth it.</p><p>I had some reservations about going, and then <a href="http://www.interllectual.com/article/126/jet-lagging">some trouble getting there</a>, and I had a bad cold the whole time, but <span class="caps">SXSW</span> was definitely worth the trouble.</p><p>I have heard mixed reviews about the panels, but for me there were a couple of gems that alone would have made the trip worthwhile.  <a href="http://37signals.com">Jason Fried&#8217;s</a> &#8220;How to Make Big Things Happen With Small Teams&#8221; was excellent, and more than enough to make the boss happy for sending me. Curt Cloninger&#8217;s &#8220;How to Hotwire the Creative Process&#8221; was also very interesting, and I&#8217;ll be taking some tidbits from that back to the group.  And Jeffrey Veen really <a href="http://2005.sxsw.com/interactive/conference/panels/?action=show&#38;id=IAP0048">set my pants on fire</a>.</p><p>Eric Meyer&#8217;s Emergent Semantics sparked some thoughts I&#8217;ll probably get into more later, and Design Eye for the Idea Guy was a lot of fun.  Panels where I learned no new content were still valuable for learning process, and for getting a little live look into the brains of the people whose work I know.  </p><p>But, as everyone else is saying, it was not about the panels. <span class="caps">SXSW</span> was really just a big giant lovefest, and I&#8217;m all about the love, baby.  (I&#8217;m also all about the beer, but that&#8217;s another story&#8230;) People were warm, friendly, and willing to talk; as jazzed as I was to be in a room full of people with like minds.  The air was electric with creativity and talent.  </p><p>The sub-text of conference&#8212; the panels as well as the hallway and bars&#8212; was &#8220;it&#8217;s all about the people&#8221;.  This conference was definitely more personal than any other I&#8217;ve been to, and it&#8217;s nice that the overall vibe was one of inclusion.  Compared to an academic conference, there was much less ego involved.</p><p>So, I got the shot in arm that I needed, and I&#8217;m definatley hooked.  I&#8217;ll be there next year, hope you will too.</p><p>Oh, and I&#8217;m pissed that <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/display.php/20050314181547.xml">Jeremy Keith stole my title</a>.</p>
