<p>Ok, this has been bugging me for <em>years</em> now.  Am I the only one that <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/c/cure/caterpillar_10074222.html">hears The Cure</a>  every time I hear or read the name <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>?</p>

<p>At first I loved being reminded of this song all the time, because it has always been one of my favorites.  And I want someone to dust my lemon lies with powder pink and sweet.  After a while, though, it started getting a bit old.</p>

<p>But last night I heard the original again and realized that my brain wasn&#8217;t even close to doing it justice.  So I&#8217;ll keep encouraging it to glow inside my head and hold me hypnotized, mesmerized&#8230;</p>
