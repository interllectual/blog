<p>I am doing a lot of work behind the scenes, getting all the MT (Movable Type) templates styled.  I will then move on to linking up the rest of the stuff in the sidebar, and building out some of the supporting pages for this site.</p><p>I am having trouble getting this page to validate; I keep getting an error stating <cite>cannot generate system identifier for general entity &#8220;entry_id&#8221;</cite>.  I need to do some research to figure out why the template markup isn&#8217;t validating.  Any info on this from you old hats out there would be great.</p><p>I am having fun playing with <a href="http://www.pixy.cz/blogg/clanky/cssnopreloadrollovers/" title="Fast rollovers, no preload needed">Pixy&#8217;s no preload rollovers</a> , and I have implemented them on the <a href="http://www.doingfine.org" title="doing fine main page">index page of this site</a>.  So far I am really liking them, and they are solving one of the barriers to getting my colleagues to accept <span class="caps">CSS</span> rollvers in general.  It&#8217;s hard to get people to embrace learning something new, even when we&#8217;re all working in the context of academia where this kind of thing is encouraged&#8230;</p>
