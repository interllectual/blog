<p>I am now home from the <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/mastery">E-rectuitment Mastery Workshop</a>, which was a great success. Thanks very much to the folks at <a href="http://www.liquidmatrix.com/">LiquidMatrix</a> and <a href="http://www.noel-levitz.com/">Noel-Levitz</a> for organizing a great event, and for asking me to participate.</p>

<p><a href="http://interllectual.com/file_download/1">Here is a pdf of the slides from my presentation</a>, which I am releasing under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">Creative Commons License</a>. I&#8217;m not sure that the slides stand on their own very well, since I tend to not put a lot of what I&#8217;m saying on my slides, but you can get a general sense of the presentation from them.</p>

<p>There was a good discussion after my talk about the benefits of providing strategic planning information to adminstrators to help them understand everything that is involved in the maintenance of  University web sites.  I mentioned a thread on the Uweb-d list that talked about estimating the total cost of University web sites; unfortunately, I have found that there is no easy way for me to link directly to archived threads on the list.  I am going to try to get permission from the participants in the thread to republish their messages here.  In the meantime, if you are interested, you can <a href="http://listserver.itd.umich.edu/cgi-bin/lyris.pl?enter=uwebd&#38;text_mode=0">join the list or log in to your account here</a>.<br />
Then, search the archives for the subject line &#8220;Total Cost of Web&#8221;.  This will get you to the thread, which talks about potential ways to estimate the cost of a University&#8217;s web site, and has some preliminary numbers that some folks came up with.  These numbers are large, and could probably help making a case for the purchase of tools or development of strategies to reduce those numbers.</p>

<p>I also discussed the idea setting up a Web Council on campus, as a way to bring together the decentralized web developers on my campus.  The idea is to meet a couple of times a semester to share resources, ideas, strategies, and generally make sure we&#8217;re on the same page and not duplicating efforts.  Later on in the conference, a participant mentioned that she tried this on her campus, which has a centralized web structure, and it was a disaster.  So I wanted to ask all of you out there if you have any experience with a similar type of set-up, or insights on this to share.</p>
