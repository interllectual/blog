<p>I got a lot of comments after my last post that I should consider some fucker mistaking me for a college freshman a compliment.</p>

<p>Um, no.  In that one misguided sentence, that guy encapsulated the professional struggle I go through every day. I am female, blonde, and I look younger than I am, and it is <em>very hard</em> for me to be seen as a serious professional in this world.  That comment was just a reminder of how far I have to go to achieve that status.</p>

<p>So I thought I&#8217;d help this guy, and anyone else who is trying to compliment a young professional woman, and list some acceptable ways to compliment me.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>I really like what you did with the (insert name here) web site.</strong> I will proceed to tell you the ways in which it still sucks, but I will feel complimented that someone actually recognized my work.</li>
<li><strong>I really enjoyed that last article you wrote.</strong> I will know you are probably lying, but I will feel all warm and fuzzy.</li>
<li><strong>We are thinking about (insert web design strategy here), and we wanted to know what you thought about it.</strong>  Ask for my professional opinion, and I will instantly like you.</li>
<li><strong>You look great, have you lost weight?</strong>  I am human after all.</li>
<li><strong>Can I buy you a drink?</strong>  The answer may be no, depending on the situation, but I will be flattered.  (Unless you are Patty wanting to buy me appletinis, and then I will know you are trying to kill me.)</li>
<li><strong>I love your shoes.</strong> The old standby&#8212; works every time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully that clears things up.  Notice the absence of references to age.</p>

<p>My next post will be about web stuff, I promise.</p>
