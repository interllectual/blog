<p>I have redesigned the main page of this blog. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to do extensive browser testing yet, so let me know if there are problems for you. There are some dead links on the left, which I set up as placeholders for what&#8217;s to come.  I will be working on these as well as styling the rest of the templates in the days to come.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this on my new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/index15.html">Titanium Powerbook</a>, which I am having much fun setting up and configuring. So far I am very pleased with it, although I&#8217;m not used to the smaller keyboared yet, and I keep hitting the caps lock instead of the &#8220;a&#8221; key.  I expect I&#8217;ll get this worked out in a couple of days.  I am now much more mobile at <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~cdc" title="I didn't design the site, I just maintain it">work</a>, since the campus has finally installed wi-fi in the Library and on the Quad.</p>

<p>The brighter site reflects the new outlook on my life that I have finally been able to reach. I am taking time for myself this Labor Day weekend, something I haven&#8217;t done since Brian got sick, and which I sorely needed lest I go insane. My biology doesn&#8217;t really allow me to thrive under the massive amounts of stress and pressure I&#8217;ve been under both at home and at work. After a day and 1/2 of my self-imposed three day isolation from most outside influences, I seem to be doing much better. It feels good to get the creative juices flowing again and not just struggle to keep my head above water.<br />
