<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about making some changes to this site, and I thought I&#8217;d do some thinking out loud here to clarify my thoughts and get some opinions if you care to share any.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m going to be retiring the Meters.  I know <a href="http://nerdistry.com">Steve</a> will be bummed about that, but I haven&#8217;t been keeping up with them.  I think the reason why I haven&#8217;t kept them up to date is that they are just too negative.  I don&#8217;t really <em>want</em> to remember how many <span class="caps">ASAP</span>s I get.  And there is no physical way to keep up with the No-Time meter.  It would be up to a few hundred thousand by now, and I really would rather not dwell on that.  It is also not good for me&#8212; I don&#8217;t really need to be creating more reasons to be down.  So, I&#8217;m thinking of replacing the meters with my latest post on <a href="http://janglyganglia.com">Jangly Ganglia</a>.  I kind of like the thought of swapping out the negative for the positive there.</p>

<p>I also want to change the Elsewhere section.  I have decided lately that I hate link blogs.  Most of them keep rehashing the same stuff, and I end up hearing about the same post about 50 times.  I subscribe to the original.  I don&#8217;t need to be notified about it repeatedly from every corner of the web.  The notion of adding to that noise isn&#8217;t really appealing to me, so I have been neglecting that section.  I am thinking of turning it into a &#8220;Notes&#8221; section, a place where I can write a small post about something I find interesting.  It may be a post on another site, a quote from a book I&#8217;m reading, a small piece of wackiness that happened that day, etc. I don&#8217;t really have a place for that&#8212; I feel like I need to write long articles in the 3 sections I have now.  A place for a short quip would feel good.  I&#8217;ll have to come up with a good drink name for that section&#8212; feel free to leave suggestions in the comments.  Brian just suggested &#8220;J?gerBombs&#8221;, but that reminds me a bit too much of a couple of unfortunate nights in college&#8230;</p>

<p>I am also thinking of recoding the site.  I don&#8217;t want to change the layout, because I still dig it, but it is just too damn slow.  I am going to look at ways to get the page weight down; I have found a couple of scripts that may help.  I also may just have to get my dad to switch to <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/downloads/default.mspx">IE7</a> so I can use transparent pngs and not have to rely on the big images I use now.</p>

<p>Plus, I want the animals back! The code I have now requires a lot of work to make a new animal theme, which is why there are only 2.  The other critters are sitting on my hard drive threatening a rebellion if I don&#8217;t get them up here soon.</p>

<p>Well, enough rambling.</p>
