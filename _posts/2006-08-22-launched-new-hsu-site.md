<p>Just a quick announcement that I recently launched a <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu">redesign of the Humboldt State University main site</a>.  This pretty much explains most of my silence for the past month or two.  The new site focuses on recruiting, which is a major goal of the university at this point, and has been in development for over 6 months.</p>

<p>Highlights include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Back end powered by <a href="http://pmachine.com">ExpressionEngine</a>.  This is a departure from my usual Textpattern; unfortunately our server configuration won&#8217;t work with the newest <span class="caps">TXP</span> version.</li>
<li>Valid <span class="caps">XHTML</span> 1.0 Strict, everywhere but where I had to tied into legacy systems.  I am slowly working on fixing those.</li>
<li>Standards-based <span class="caps">CSS</span> layout (of course)</li>
<li>Kick-ass photos from our campus photographer</li>
<li>A new <a href="http://www.humboldt.edu/~humboldt/explore">virtual tour</a> where we got our feet wet with Flash</li>
<li>Better semantics, and a much more efficient back end structure</li>
<li>Writing from our Public Affairs department&#8212; up until now I&#8217;ve had to scrape together the content myself, and it showed</li>
<li><a href="http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/">Thickbox</a> used for supplemental stories for banner photos</li>
<li>User editable quick links</li>
</ul>

<p>I will be writing more on some of the specifics in the near future, but for now, enjoy.</p>
